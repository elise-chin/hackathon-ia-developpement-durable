71,"1. El Salvador, the smallest country in Central America and one of the most densely populated in the world, has  registered persistent low levels of growth in the past decades. With a population of 6.4 million (in addition to 1.5 million  Salvadorian living outside the country) and a total land area of 21,041 square kilometers, the country is one of the world's  most densely populated.1 The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annual growth has reached 3 percent only twice since 2000,  with an average of 2.3 percent in recent years. In 2019 the GDP grew 2.3 percent, fueled by remittances, robust domestic  consumption, and investment2. In 2020, it contracted by 7.9 percent due to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID 2019)  and has begun recovering in 2021 (projected growth of 8 percent)3. However, public debt remains high, up to 91.8 percent  of GDP in 2020, and constitutes the main vulnerability of economic performance, whereas fiscal deficits have constrained  the overall competitiveness. Persistent high levels of illegal activities and gang-related violence deter private investments  and slow public investments. Facing limited employment opportunities and high exposure to crime and violence, many  Salvadorians have migrated from the country. By early 2020, remittances from abroad accounted for nearly one-fifth of  the country's GDP4. Poverty has declined since 2007 but remains high: in 2019, 23 percent of the population lived below  the poverty line, and 1.5 percent in extreme poverty conditions.5,6 "
72,"2. El Salvador’s high vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change negatively affects is economy. The  country is among the most affected by weather-related events and other hazards, incurring annual losses of around 2.5  percent of GDP.7  It also ranks second highest for risk exposure to two or more hazards, and highest for the total population  at a relatively high risk of mortality. It is estimated that over 90 percent of the population live in areas considered at risk  of natural hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and climate-related impacts such as floods, droughts, and  storms.8 Projections for the 2040-2059 period indicate there will be an increase in annual maximum 5-days rainfall by  18.75 mm, as well as in mean annual temperature by 1.64°C. The annual precipitation, on the other hand, will decrease  by -65.33mm, in the same period. The most frequent natural disasters are droughts, floods, storms, earthquakes, and  volcanic activity. The occurrence of extreme rainfall events threatens the food and water security and livelihoods of people  living on degraded hilly lands. Also, rising temperatures are predicted to reduce the country’s yields of main crops by 30  percent by 2050, mainly through recurrent drought.9 "
73,"3. Furthermore, the consequences of COVID-19 have significantly affected the economy and people's livelihoods.  By December 2021, El Salvador confirmed 121,200 cases of COVID-19 and 3797 deaths10. Due to the pandemic, the poverty  rate increased by 4.6 percentage points from 2019 and 202011. The Government responded with early quarantines,  movement restrictions, and severe penalties for not respecting the confinement measures. An economic reopening plan "

77,"was issued on June 1, 2020, expecting to reactivate sectorial activity progressively. The World Bank (WB), among other  international organizations, provided support to El Salvador through an Emergency Response Project under the COVID-19  Strategic Preparedness and Response Program (SPRP), with a loan of US$20 million12. Due to the pandemic's economic  impacts, thousands of jobs have been lost, potentially promoting a rural migration in some areas as unemployed adults  move to the country in search of sustenance opportunities.13 "
78,"4. El Salvador’s rich and diverse natural capital is crucial to sustaining key sectors of the economy and support the  livelihoods of the rural poor. Natural capital represents 10 percent of total per capita wealth, including from crop lands,  pasture lands, and forests. These assets underpin important sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, forestry, and  fishing, which together contributed to 16 percent of the GDP, in 2018. Agriculture alone contributed around 12 percent  to the GDP, supporting the livelihoods of the rural poor through food security and employment.14 ,15,16 The forest sector,  on the other hand, contributed 1.5 percent of the GDP, mainly from wood products (57 percent) and generated about 0.5  percent of the labor force, representing two percent of agriculture. The forest sector also produces goods and income for  many small subsistence farmers from Non-Timber Forestry Products (NTFPs), and it is source of fuelwood for  approximately 23 percent of the rural population and 3.5 percent of the urban one.17 Although not accounted in the GDP,  the ecosystem services provided by forests are also critical for the viability of productive sectors and the rural livelihoods  as they contribute to ensure water supply; reduce soil erosion, landslides, sedimentation, and risk of floods; enhance  resilience to climate change; and conserve the habitats  of some 33,871 species. Mangroves, for example, play a crucial  role for coastal communities as are essential nursery habitat for fisheries and protect shorelines from storms and  hurricane winds, waves, and floods.18,19  "
79,"5. Despite its importance, the country’s natural capital is rapidly degrading due to unsustainable land use, which  leads to high fragmentation of critical forest ecosystems. Currently, the country’s rural landscape is composed of intricate  mosaics that include forest patches, coffee farms, pasture, bushes, subsistence crops, and sugarcane, among others, while  the remaining area of natural ecosystems is limited. Approximately 60 percent of the territory is used for agricultural  production, and farms cover 80 percent of the land area in a diverse agriculture-forest-landscape20. Although forests cover  approximately 38.8 percent of the country’s territory, they are young and fragmented secondary forests (58 percent) and  shaded coffee (21 percent). Forests have been lost at an estimated average annual rate of 2.6 percent, equivalent to about  21,700 ha/year, which places the country as the second most deforested in Latin America; in the last five decades, the  country lost 60 percent of its mangroves, passing from almost 100,000 ha to only 40,000 ha.21   "
80,"6. Deforestation and forest degradation undermine ecosystem services, disturb local water systems, and cause  severe land degradation, threatening agricultural productivity and exacerbating the country's vulnerability to climate  change and food insecurity.  Forest loss, underlain by rural poverty, rural land fragmentation, demographic growth, and "

83,"the low opportunity cost of forests, has become a major concern since critical environmental thresholds have been  reached, where the vulnerability of agricultural practices and food security are at historical limits.22  Approximately 15  percent of the country’s territory is experiencing severe land degradation, a major source of vulnerability, climate-risk,  and food and water insecurity. Half of the land area is considered unsuitable for food cultivation due to overuse of  agrochemicals, leading to water and soil contamination as well as soil erosion; over 42 percent of landslide-prone areas  and 64 percent of main water recharge areas lack tree cover; and more than half of the riparian forests associated to the  main rivers have been lost.23 Deforestation and land degradation also leads to habitat loss, the main threat to biodiversity  conservation.  "
84,"7. Improving the management of natural resources at the landscape level is important to enhance the country’s  resilience to weather-related events and for providing economic opportunities for rural economies. Healthy agriculture  and forest landscapes can offset some of the impacts of climate-related disasters by enhancing the forest ecosystem’s  resilience to changing weather patterns, providing important safety nets for local communities to cope with climate  shocks, enhancing the productivity of farming systems, and reducing damage from flooding and sea level rise, among  others. In addition, forest landscapes provide key ecosystem services such as biodiversity habitat, water filtration and  availability, increased food security, soil erosion control, and reduction of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. The  unsustainable management of these natural assets negatively affect rural jobs and revenue generation, impacting  economic growth and disproportionally affecting the rural poor and vulnerable communities. The COVID-19 pandemic  precipitates deforestation and forest degradation associated to an increased internal demand for food, raw material, and  commodities, often satisfied through unsustainable farming systems - by August 2020, global deforestation rates had  increased 77 percent during the pandemic. "
85,"8. Sustainable natural resources management and land restoration is the joint responsibility of two ministries.  The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, MARN) is responsible  for implementing the National Environmental Policy, which provides the framework for sustainable use of natural  resource protection, conservation, and restoration of the environment. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock  (Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganadería, MAG) administers the regulations for agriculture, irrigation, forestry, fisheries, and  aquaculture. MAG implements national regulations and planning through the General Directorate of Forestry,  Watersheds, and Irrigation (Dirección General Ordenamiento Forestal, Cuencas, y Riego, DGFCR) and provides extension  and technology transfer through the National Agricultural and Forestry Technology Center (Centro Nacional de Tecnología  Agropecuaria y Forestal, CENTA). Locally, municipalities and local governments implement projects in their territories  according to Local Sustainable Development Plans (Planes Locales de Desarrollo Sostenible, PDLS). MARN and MAG  coordinate with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), international development agencies, and local stakeholders  for the implementation of land restoration policies seeking to promote rural development and ecosystems’ adaptation to  the impacts of climate change.  "
86,"9. In its efforts to address forest loss and environmental degradation, El Salvador has established an enabling a  national regulatory framework to implement integrated forest landscape restoration. Various policies, plans, and  programs established in El Salvador during the past two decades have identified the consolidation of forest management,  conservation, and restoration as a key priority for reducing the country’s vulnerability to climate change and extreme  climate events. MARN and MAG coordinate implementation of (i) the 2003 National Action Program to Combat  Desertification and Drought (Programa de Acción Nacional de Lucha contra la Desertificación y Sequía, PANSAL24); (ii) the  2004 National Plan for Territorial Planning and Development (Plan Nacional de Ordenamiento y Desarrollo Territorial, "

PREP has provided the framework to counter land degradation  and served as the basis for developing other key policy instruments such as (v) the 2015 Environmental Strategy for  Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change in the Agriculture, Forest, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Sector (Estrategia "
90,"Ambiental de Adaptación y Mitigación al Cambio Climático del Sector Agropecuario, Forestal, Pesquero y Acuícola29); (vi)  the 2017 National REDD+ Mitigation Based Adaptation Strategy for Restoration of Ecosystems and Landscapes30 "

These policy instruments have been designed  to contribute to achieving international commitments such as: the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD’s) Aichi  Targets36; the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC´s) Nationally Determined Contribution  (NDC) under the Paris Agreement; and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD’s) Land  Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and its Action Plan. "
92,"10. The Government of El Salvador (GoES) is advancing implementation of existing policy instruments, while  exploring opportunities to design fiscal policy reforms for a green economy. Implementation builds on extensive  experience gained since more than two decades ago through projects supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF)  on environmental management and strategic planning; capacity building on biodiversity conservation and protected areas  management; promotion of biodiversity conservation in coffee landscapes and markets for biodiversity; adaptation to  climate change; and testing models for integrated management of protected areas, among others. Furthermore,  in the   2014-2020 period, El Salvador implemented restauration actions in 241,662 hectares (ha) of degraded lands.37 Most  recent actions have been informed by in-depth participatory analysis such as (i) a comprehensive assessment of historic  trends and causes of deforestation and forest degradation, carried out in preparation for the EN-REP design with support  from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) REDD+ Readiness Preparation Project (P124935); (ii) application of the  Restoration Opportunity Assessment Methodology (ROAM38) methodology to identify cost-effective options for land  restoration at national scale, with support from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other "

"
96,"11. Under this context, El Salvador aims to implement the ecosystems and landscape restoration approach at the  Conservations Areas scale, the administrative regions for natural resource management created under the PNODT. The  El Imposible y Barra de Santiago Conservation Area (EIBSCA) has been prioritized in the National Plan Against  Deforestation, Soil Erosion, and Desertification due to prominent levels of poverty, particularly in six municipalities of the  Ahuachapán department within the Corredor Seco, and considerable environmental pressures from agriculture. EIBSCA  provides essential environmental services, including from El Imposible National Park, the Barra de Santiago Ramsar site,  and Los Cóbanos Important Bird Area; it is habitat for twenty-three vulnerable species, ten endangered, and five critically  endangered under IUCN’s Red List of Endangered Species. EIBSCA is highly vulnerable to land degradation as it contains  steep (more than 35 percent) slopes and is especially prone to droughts; it contains an entire water basin, which connects  the practices of subsistence basic grain producers with sugarcane producers.  However, unplanned expansion of sugar  cane and basic grain crops coupled with unsustainable production practices are degrading land and biodiversity in  ecosystems across EIBSCA, including mangroves and riparian forests, and soil within farms, reducing their productivity and  environmental sustainability. Sugar cane plantations increased from 60,000 to 80,000 ha in the 2006-2015 period leading  to loss of mangrove forests, and the displacement of traditional crops to higher mountain areas, which are consequently  degraded and affect the provision of hydrological services for the overall country's economy, and particularly for  sugarcane crops themselves. The use of unsustainable practices and continued deforestation to produce basic grains for  subsistence has aggravated erosion in the high areas of the region. The pressure of recent droughts and extreme weather  events that lead to landslides combined with these factors exacerbate land degradation.  "
97,"12. Several initiatives are contributing to revert land degradation in the EIBSCA region. These include local  governance platforms such as groups of water boards and agricultural associations; the Ramsar committee; and Local  Advisor Committees (Comités Asesores Locales, COAL), among others. Also, ongoing projects in the region or in  neighboring areas are implementing some dimensions of landscape restoration in specific areas and providing valuable  lessons. For example, the project Upscaling Climate Resilience Measures in the Dry Corridor Agroecosystems of El Salvador  (known as RECLIMA), co-financed by the Green Climate Fund (GCF)40, which has a national scope but targets some highly  vulnerable municipalities of EIBSCA. Other programs and projects include the Resilient Central America (ResCA41)  Program; the Ecosystems Restoration in Degraded Areas in EIBSCA project42; the Strengthening the Climatic Resilience of  Rural Communities and Ecosystems in Ahuachapán-Sur43; the Enabling Concerted Management from the Source to the  Ocean in the Rio Paz Watershed GEF project; and the GEF Project Climate Change Adaptation to Reduce Land Degradation  in Fragile Micro Watersheds Located in the Municipalities of Texistepeque and Candelaria de la Frontera, among others.  Projects currently undergoing preparation seek to address new areas such as developing an incentive program to promote "

Past and existing projects have produced positive impacts in certain areas of EIBSCA, but they are  unaligned with the aim of ecosystem services provision at the conservation area level. Projects are often scattered in  specific protected areas, communities, watersheds, or coastal zones, aiming at achieving land restoration for different  purposes such as biodiversity protection, water sources conservation, soil retention, or climate change adaptation and  resilience. However, landscape management and restoration in EIBSCA entails addressing in an integral manner the  following barriers: (i) high vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather; (ii) limited incentives for sustainable  agriculture practices; (iii) a lack of human and financial resources to promote sustainable production; (iv) perverse "

111,"15. The proposed Project contributes directly to the GEF objectives in the focal areas of Biodiversity and Land  Degradation. The Project advances the GEF-7 Biodiversity Focal Area (BD1-1) by mainstreaming biodiversity across sectors  and supporting informed decision-making that considers biodiversity and ecosystem values. It will particularly contribute  to achieving the following country’s Aichi targets49: Target #2 incorporating biodiversity considerations into land-use  planning; Target # 5 reducing the loss of natura habitats; Target #7 sustainable management of agriculture and forest  areas; Target #14 rehabilitation of ecosystem services; and Target # 15 restoration of at least 15 percent of degraded  lands. The Project will also contribute to the main objectives of the Land Degradation Focal Area (LD-1-1 & 3, LD-2-5) by  creating an enabling environment for PANSAL implementation and the country’s development of the voluntary LDN  targets.  "
112,"16. The proposed Project aligns with the World Bank Group’s corporate goals, Climate Change Action Plan, Forest  Action Plan, and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY15-19 for El Salvador (Report # 95383) discussed by the  Executive Directors on June 23, 2015. Specifically, the Project directly addresses issues related to the Bank's overarching  Twin Goals (eradicating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity). This is achieved by promoting sustainable  agricultural productivity that supports jobs and food security and enhancing the sustainability of small-scale farm  producers in one of the most vulnerable regions of El Salvador. The Project is also consistent with the El Salvador CPF’s  Objective (b) Build Capacity to Manage Disasters and Environmental Degradation, under Strategic Pilar II Fostering  Sustainability. Similarly, the Project contributes to compliance with the Climate Change Action Plan 2016-202050,  particularly on Priority III Scale Up Climate Action by promoting climate-smart land-use including elements of SLM, land  restoration, ecosystem-based adaptation, and coastal area management, as well as Climate Change Action Plan 2021- 202551 under the Agriculture, Food, Water, and Land heading, which emphasizes Nature-Based Solutions. Also, the  proposed project advances the Forest Action Plan FY16-FY2052, particularly on Focus Area 2: Forest Smart Interventions  in Other Economic Sectors, and by addressing cross cutting themes such as climate change and resilience; participation  and rights; and institutions and governance. The Project builds on the FCPF REDD+ Readiness Preparation Project  (P124935) and the 2020 Country Forest Note: A Green Deal for El Salvador: Forest-based Green Infrastructure for Income  and Services53.

The Project would help advance preparation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and contribute to  implement the 2021 National Plan to Combat Deforestation, Erosion, and Desertification, particularly activities under  Component 1 such as implementation of the environmental zoning, promotion of agroforestry systems, as well as  restoration of critical ecosystems and natural habitats for biodiversity. Moreover, the Project contributes to the United  Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), particularly goal 15: Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of  terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt  biodiversity loss54. As El Salvador is among the countries participating in the UNCCD Program on LDN Targets Setting, this  project is aligned with this engagement. Finally, the Project is well-positioned to contribute to advancing the country’s  NDC which identifies agriculture and water among the priority areas for climate action to promote climate change  adaptation, while setting GHG mitigation targets across sectors through improved forest cover. The nature-based  solutions promoted by the proposed Project would also contribute to enhance ecosystems resilience to the impacts of  climate change by enhancing local governance for land restoration, forest-ecosystems services protection, and  implementation of SLM practices.

This includes small subsistence farms (<3 ha), family farms, and communities that mainly produce basic  grains in slopes and near relevant ecosystems. At least 1040 producers will receive support for restoration practices and  conserving key ecosystems. These will be selected from the municipalities in the Ahuachapán Department, including San  Pedro Puxtla, Guaymango, Jujutla, San Francisco Menéndez y Ataco, prioritizing vulnerable populations such as women,  young and indigenous communities. Approximately 250 sugar cane producers, medium and smallholders located in the  municipalities of Acajutla, San Francisco Menéndez, and Jujutla will benefit from technical assistance for restoration  activities and SLM implementation. Additionally, local governance bodies will be strengthened, especially water boards,  COAL, and Ramsar committees, providing them with technical capacity and promoting collaborative arrangements. Hence,  approximately 575 more people will benefit directly from the support to the local planning processes (PLAS) under  Component 1. The total number of direct beneficiaries is therefore expected to reach 1,865.  "
119,"20. Indirect beneficiaries include the population in the entire landscape, especially those in the selected basins. The  198,556 inhabitants of the region, especially the rural population, will benefit from improved ecosystem services (mainly  hydrological), reduced erosion, disaster risks, and water contamination. This includes Indigenous Peoples (IPs), vulnerable  small farmers, and the communities associated with the basins' ecosystem services at the landscape scale. Simultaneously,  biodiversity in the area will benefit from improved habitat conditions, as well as ecosystem connectivity and health.  "

In Component 2, small and large producers will receive training on improved productive practices, and their  participation will be essential for validating SLM practices and disseminating results (see paragraph 27). As stakeholders,  private producers of basic grains, sugarcane, coffee, and cocoa have a vested interest in reducing production costs and  increasing profitability. Under Subcomponent 2.2, sugarcane industries will support project activities to help producers  implement improved and more sustainable production practices.  "
124,"22. The Project will also benefit public agencies that are involved in integrated landscape management. Specifically,  the Project will enhance the technical capacities of MARN, MAG, CENTA, DGFCR, seven municipalities, NGOs, and public  foundations El Salvador Environmental Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversión Ambiental de El Salvador, FIAES) and the El  Salvador Environmental Fund (Fondo Ambiental de El Salvador, FONAES), to address landscape-scale restoration and  integrated landscape management efforts. It will also promote improved coordination and collaboration among MARN  and other national-level agencies, local governments, participative governance instances and the Ahuachapán  Coordination Roundtable.

The MRdR, which  would be established under the COAL, would be responsible for updating the PDLS of EIBSCA and will support the Ramsar  Committee in updating the Ramsar Management Plan. The MRdR would liaise with the existing Ahuachapán Coordination  Roundtable, which integrates donor partners and implementing agencies of relevant projects in the region.  "
135,"25. Subcomponent 2. Promotion of Awareness on the Importance of Ecosystem Services (GEF US$374,359). In  addition, this component will build awareness about the importance of ecosystem services in the landscape and  environmental degradation by: (i) conducting an assessment of the value of ecosystem services within EIBSCA through a  technical consultancy; (ii) disseminating the results of this study and improved management practices through the design  and implementation of an environmental education plan (using local and regional media towards the general public and  especially the agricultural producers) and three PLAS, including information on restoration, land tenure security, and  gender equity issues; and (iii) providing training and equipment to enhance the existing technical capacity to curate and  implement the ISR as a key monitoring tool (see paragraph 10). The component will support the process to update the ISR  2016 version to incorporate new biodiversity and degradation considerations. The process updated would provide a  perspective of the changes in the landscape and the effectiveness of restoration projects, while enhancing MARN's  monitoring and evaluation capacity to implement it. The ISR will be applied across the EIBSCA landscape, which covers  67,655 ha (this area represents the total project area). "
136,"26. Subcomponent 3. Development of proposed mechanisms to promote private financial resource mobilization  (GEF US$117,360). Finally, to create sustainable conditions for maintaining the Project's conservation and restoration  results, this component will provide technical assistance to promote pilot private financial resource mobilization through  pilot Compensation for Ecosystem Services (“CES”) to be granted to Eligible Beneficiaries. The Project will provide technical  assistance to negotiate pilot agreements between sugarcane producers and upstream farmers as CES, through which  upstream small-scale farmers are expected to receive compensation for maintaining riparian forests and protecting water  recharge areas and water quality, which benefit downstream sugarcane producers. The agreements will be coordinated  through the MRdR in alignment with the Ahuachapán Coordination Roundtable. "

The Project Operational Manual (POM) will include a full list of selection and  exclusion criteria. The activities will include: (i) capacity building to enhance the extension services that will support  the restoration activities; (ii) establishing 40 ha of demonstration plots for training and dissemination purposes, which  will contribute to the Environmental Education Plan under Component 1 and help train beneficiaries; and (iii)  restoration of degraded land in 1,000 ha of small and medium-scale farms, at an average of 1 ha per farmer. The  restoration activities will reach at least 140 ha of cocoa agroforestry, 520 ha of basic grains agroforestry, 200 ha of  agro-silvo-pastoral lands, 100 ha of gallery forests, and 40 ha of mangroves. This subcomponent will provide up to 70  percent of the financial resources required for the restoration activities and the maintenance of restored ecosystems  for three years, including technical assistance from extension services. The beneficiaries will complement 30 percent  of the cost with labor and in-kind assistance. All three activities for this component will be implemented through local  NGOs with work experience in the project area. "
143,"(ii) Subcomponent 2. Support for improved agricultural practices in the production of sugar cane (GEF US$172,980).  The objective is to promote sustainable farming practices in the sugarcane industry. The activities under this  subcomponent will target the municipalities of San Francisco Menéndez, Jujutla, and Acajutla, where most of the  sugarcane production is concentrated in EIBSCA. Demonstration activities will target key farms that are next to the  Ramsar site. Specifically, the subcomponent will provide technical support and capacity strengthening to promote the  adoption of sustainable practices and biodiversity criteria, towards achieving the BONSUCRO standard certification  particularly with regards to its ""Manage biodiversity and ecosystems"" principle. Although some sugarcane producers  have implemented BONSUCRO up to standard 4.1, progress has been slow and especially difficult for smaller-scale  farmers. The Project would accelerate and spread out the BONSUCRO standard implementation. The activities to be  financed include (i) strengthening technical capacity for 250 sugarcane producers with the support of FUNDAZUCAR  and the Corporate Foundation for Social Action (Fundación Empresarial para la Acción Social, FUNDEMAS); and (ii) the  restoration and implementation of improved practices56 on 20 selected pilot farms (one ha/farm) in critical  ecosystems with degraded lands, especially in farms located close to fragile ecosystems such as mangroves, and in  important areas for ecosystem connectivity. These will serve as demonstrative plots to disseminate and prove the  effectiveness of implementing sustainable productive practices, to further expand their uptake beyond the Project.  "

Concrete knowledge produced by previous projects includes the use of IUCN’s ROAM Analysis for prioritizing land  for restoration, and the use and strengthening of the ISR for monitoring the sustainability of actions in the area. Similarly,  a baseline for identifying agroforestry opportunities and governance gaps were obtained from the WB’s forestry and  climate change efforts, such as the Country Forest Note and the FCPF REDD+ Readiness Preparation Project. The technical  guidance for improved practices and restoration activities will draw from IUCN’s guidelines and the experience of FIAES  and FONAES in working with the local communities of the area. The Project incorporates learnings from these and other  projects for the participatory processes and design, especially regarding the framing of the activities, resource allocations  and budgeting, technical assistance, and active gender inclusion, which will help reduce social, political, and technical  risks. Lessons from other countries in the region like Guatemala have also informed the Project including on CES and multi- sector approaches: Integrated landscape operations benefit from the support of a national approach that addresses key  bottlenecks in the forest sector governance and establishes inter-institutional coordination and financial mechanisms to  incentivize the participation of multiple stakeholders in the integrated generation of timber, NTFPs, and ecosystem and  environmental services obtained from sustainable land use, land-use change, and forestry.

Data for M&E project  outcomes will be derived from various sources that feed national processes such as the PANSAL. The results will be  followed up in midterm and final reviews to assess the project activities’ outcomes.  "
173,"38. The Project will contribute to reducing pressures on local biodiversity, including endangered species, advance  compliance with LDN and climate change mitigation through the restoration and improved management of a  Conservation Area, EIBSCA, identified by MARN as a critical area for biodiversity conservation. The outcomes of the  practices promoted by the Project as well as the restoration of critical land will contribute to reducing pressures, increasing  connectivity for globally important biodiversity and ecosystems. Importantly, the EIBSCA is one of the sites with the  highest species richness and the occurrence of restricted species in the country. It includes protected areas and globally  relevant areas, while hosting important biodiversity (see Section I.B.).  "
174,"39. The Project is aligned with four GEF focal areas: BD-1-1, LD-1-1, LD-1-3, and LD-2-5. The Project would help  integrate biodiversity and improve the flow of services in agroecosystems in EIBSCA, by promoting improved management  and restoration of degraded land, by piloting improved practices involving cocoa, agro-silvo-pastoral systems, as well as  agroforestry systems and basic grains. The Project will also help maintain and enhance the flow of ecosystem services  through the restoration of gallery forests and mangroves, as well as by strengthening governance at the landscape level  and promoting private compensation for ecosystem services agreements. Finally, the Project would help reduce the  pressure on fragile forest ecosystems from sugar cane by supporting the adoption of improved agriculture practices, which  will help enhance the resilience of the wider landscape. The Project will apply the ISR, which contains indicators to monitor  progress on biodiversity, governance, water quality, vulnerability reduction, climate change mitigation, and livelihoods  enhancement. "
175,"40. GHG analysis. An estimate of the Project’s GHG mitigation potential was prepared using the Ex-Ante carbon  balance tool (EX-ACT) from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). See Annex 5 for details. The preliminary analysis  compares the current land uses and productive practices prior to the project implementation (“business as usual”) and  the improved system, considering the restored land and better production practices promoted by the Project. The analysis  was performed over 20 years, estimating that the Project is a carbon sink of 444,851 tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent  (tCO2-eq). Subcomponent 2.1 on implementation of restoration activities contributes the greatest to reducing emissions. "
176,"41. Areas of land restored. The proposed project seeks to restore the functions of critical ecosystems in EIBSCA  through assisting the recovery of land in 1,040 ha carefully selected using multiple environmental criteria. The Project will  restore agriculture land that have been degraded to the extent that it cannot fulfill its ecological functions and delivery of  environmental services. The Project will make investments to promote restoration practices rigorously designed through  applying the ROAM methodology, which integrate results from a participatory process and from technical and cost-benefit  analysis. The selected practices will be established in critical sites to ensure they contribute to enhanced water  conservation, groundwater recharge, and improved vegetative cover. The practices include basic grains, cocoa, agro-silvo- pastoral systems, and agroforestry systems. The Project would also help apply best practices of ecological restoration in  100 ha of gallery forests and in 40 ha of mangroves. The impacts of these interventions on water quality and biodiversity "
177,  The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration (P170854) 
178,enhancement across the landscape and specific ecosystems will be captured through the ISR and the project results  framework.  
179,"42. Areas of landscapes under Improved practices (excluding protected areas). The proposed project seeks to  promote the adoption of new and/or improved SLM practices in 52,014 ha of land. Adoption refers to change of practice  or change in the use of a technology promoted or introduced by the Project. SLM practices refers to a combination of  technologies and approaches to increase land quality and restore degraded lands. Out of the total areas, the Project would  promote land management approaches that benefit biodiversity in 51,294 ha. The Project would also intervene on  landscape area currently under unsustainable sugar cane production, by promoting adoption of the BONSUCRO standard,  which seek to prevent the cultivation of sugarcane on areas of critical conservation value or areas legally protected. The  BONSUCRO standard also seek ensure sugarcane plantations address environmental issues such as biodiversity,  ecosystem services, soil, water, climate change, among others following an appropriate environmental impact and  management plan. The BONSUCRO standard also certifies adequate implementation and progress monitored of the  Environmental impact and management plan.     "
180,"43. GEF Incremental Analysis. Assuming the GEF project was not implemented (“Business as usual”), current practices  would continue to increase land, water, and biodiversity degradation. Other small-scale interventions in the landscape  are scattered without the Project and lack a strategic framework for coordinating efforts. Moreover, without the Project,  the GoES does not have the resources to promote, coordinate the objectives, or adequately monitor and evaluate  integrated land management and restoration activities. Consequently, the natural resources will continue to be used  without consideration for sustaining the provision of ecosystem services critical for the local communities and biodiversity.  Deforestation of 1.3 percent annually is expected to continue or be exacerbated by the effects of the current economic  crisis, and soil degradation will further expose the landscape to climate change related hazards such as landslides.  Similarly, habitats and downstream water quality would be lost, making future restoration efforts more challenging and  complex. The sustainability of agricultural production in the landscape would be at risk in the mid-term due to increased  vulnerability and reduced productivity.  "
181,"44. Investments with GEF support will enable the GoES to address the management of the EIBSCA by promoting  sustainable practices at a landscape scale, improving coordination through existing and new institutions, and financing  demonstration plots with improved management practices and restoration activities in critical farms. A considerable  gap between downstream sugarcane producers and the ecosystem services originating from upstream small-scale farms,  cannot be effectively addressed in the baseline scenario. Through the PAR, the local governments have prioritized  sugarcane and basic-grain farms connected by waterways across the EIBSCA region. However, they fail to connect medium  or large-scale sugarcane farmers in the lowlands with small-scale farmers in the high areas to achieve integrated landscape  management. The Project will target resources based on existing IUCN and WRI analyses and thorough consultation  processes to guide land and beneficiaries’ prioritization. GEF funding will primarily finance improved practices and  restoration activities in collaboration with current projects from FIAES and other organizations and prepare farmers to  understand the benefits and promote these practices beyond the Project. The proposed approach will improve  collaborative governance structures, support farmers with initial investments, train them to implement and maintain  improved practices, and then promote these practices while building up the capacities of extension services to implement  further actions towards integrated landscape management of the EIBSCA.  "
182,"45. The Project investments will generate synergies with projects supported by GCF, FAO, and UNDP in the region  and more broadly across El Salvador. Through the Ahuachapán’s Roundtable, coordinated by MARN, a series of parallel  interventions have been identified as relevant for generating synergies. The Project will be implemented in collaboration  and constant dialogue with these through the mentioned Roundtable, aggregating positive impacts in the landscape and  accelerating the transition to an integrated landscape management that is beneficial for biodiversity and climate action.  Specifically, RECLIMA, to be implemented across El Salvador including the EIBSCA, will contribute to climate resilience and "
183,  The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration (P170854) 
184,"mitigation within agricultural systems; UNDP’s project to strengthen the climate resilience of rural communities and  ecosystems in part the EIBSCA (US$8 million) will also support improved governance, management, and planning; and a  collaborative project in the EIBSCA is complementing the restoration of over 4,000 ha (US$2 million). The Project will also  build on other projects led by MARN, with support from GIZ, to integrate valuable lessons on monitoring of restoration  activities.   D. Sustainability "
185,"46. A combination of investment support to leverage high upfront costs, capacity building, and demonstrative  projects will help secure the long-term adoption of new sustainable practices. These efforts will be aligned with parallel  financing from a series of projects currently under development and to be implemented in the future from the GCF, FAO,  UNDP, German Cooperation Agency (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH, GIZ) and others,  which will be aligned through the MARN and Ahuachapán’s Coordination Roundtable, further augmenting the impacts of  the Project and helping secure their sustainability. A series of reciprocal CES agreements will complement these  developments to finance restoration from private and target natural water management and secure ecosystem services.  The arrangements will provide long term financial resources from sugarcane producers for ongoing operations and  maintenance of restoration and conservation activities to upstream farmers. They are expected to prompt other similar  agreements in the area. They will also increase recognition and highlight ecosystems’ role in water management and the  importance of their protection.  "
186,"47. The Project seeks to strengthening the technical capacity of public institutions, local NGOs, and participatory  governance platforms, securing support for restoration and sustainable practices. Component 1 will finance PLAS and a  new restoration roundtable (i.e., MRdR), which will guide long-term restoration and sustainable and local natural resource  management. Simultaneously, an environmental education plan will be developed to disseminate the benefits of  ecosystem services in support of various project activities. This plan will first produce knowledge about previous similar  interventions’ success and then increase the population’s knowledge base, thus increasing support for current and future  restoration projects. Under Component 2, sustainable farming practices will be institutionalized through extension  support schemes, facilitating long-term financial resources. Implementing the BONSUCRO standard for sugarcane  producers in the selected locations will secure sustainable practices in the long-term and promote the transition to SLM  in other areas. These practices will be supported in farms that have already integrated some elements of the BONSUCRO  standard in their management plans for several years, demonstrating their interest in adopting the standard’s practices. "
187,"48. Knowledge management. The PIU will be responsible for knowledge management and dissemination. The  information produced through the implementation of, and improvements to the ISR will be made available through  MARN’s and MAG’s public platforms, reporting key indicators associated with the sustainability of the landscape and  restoration activities. These elements will also be included in PAR and EN-REP reports. Through the environmental  education plan, the Project will disseminate the knowledge generated in the Project and other previous projects in the  area, contributing to improving the information baseline for planners, technicians, and stakeholders involved in managing  the landscape. The M&E system will also generate other knowledge products and services that will be disseminated among  project beneficiaries through a range of communication channels, using user-friendly communication tools. During project  implementation, MARN will ensure continued learning exchanges among existing projects through the Ahuachapán  roundtable, which brings together all the landscape initiatives in the region. Besides the project knowledge management  strategy and the communications plan, MARN will disseminate project information in the World Overview of Conservation  Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)58. "
188,  The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration (P170854) 
189,"49. Innovation and replication potential. The proposed project seeks to foster a transformation of the EIBSCA  landscape by bringing together individuals, communities, businesses, NGOs, and government institutions to participate in  a governance platform at the level of the Conservation Area. The Project addresses interinstitutional coordination barriers  for landscape transformation at such a scale. It seeks to enhance participatory territorial planning involving public and  private stakeholders and promotes private sector engagement on environmental services agreements, SLM  implementation, and certification (i.e., through BONSUCRO). The Project is innovative in applying the ISR for progress  monitoring at scale; it also represents a test to implement in an integrated manner the GoES international commitments  acquired under UNFCCC, UNCCD, and CBD, following the 2021 National Plan to Combat Deforestation, Erosion, and  Desertification. The Project is the first of its kind in El Salvador to implement landscape management and restoration at  the conservation area level, in line with the ambition established in the PREP. The lessons learned from implementing this  project would be used to progressively replicate the experience in the remaining 15 conservation areas. "
190,"50. The technical analysis has been based on the guidelines prepared for PANSAL and EN-REP, the baseline from the  ROAM analysis by IUCN, and the sector diagnosis set in the Bank’s 2020 Country Forest Note59. The project design has also  drawn from the project experience of FIAES and FUNDEMAS and the ground experience from FUNDAZUCAR regarding  BONSUCRO standard. The technical formulation also received the Bank team’s support during a series of in-country and  virtual preparation support missions in 2020 and 2021. "
191,"51. The economic analysis presents the economic benefits generated by the Project (see Annex 6). Three benefit  streams have been measured: (i) ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits provided by Integrated Landscape  Management, (ii) carbon storage and sequestration by sustainable practices and restoration, and (iii) mangrove  restoration and activities at the producer level, enabling them to transit to sustainable management activities that have  positive social and private returns.  "
192,"52. For the economic and financial analysis, the “business-as-usual” baseline case assumes that future development  trends follow those of the past and no changes in policies and practices will take place. A 20-year period has been  assumed to assess the economic feasibility of the Project. While the project costs are only assumed to emerge for the five  years of project implementation, the benefits (from the increased area under improved landscape management and  sustainable practices) and opportunity costs are assumed to be generated beyond the five-year implementation period.  "
193,"53. The incremental economic analysis shows that the net present value (NPV) is projected to reach US$5.2 million  (lower bound), and US$6 million (upper bound) in the baseline scenario (20 years, carbon social price of US$60, and 6  percent discount rate). The investments evaluated for the economic and financial assessment will generate a Benefit- Cost ratio between 2.36 and 2.52; and an internal rate of return (IRR) between 23 and 25 percent. Thus, the economic  and financial analysis shows that, if project implementation is effective and efficient, project-supported investments will  bring substantial financial and economic benefits to agriculture and livestock producers in the project area and to  Salvadoran society in general. The results of the quantitative simulations are robust in terms of sensitivity analyses.  Increasing the discount rate from six to nine percent, reducing the carbon social price by 33 percent (from US$60 to "

197,54. Shown estimates correspond to a lower bound as they represent the benefit streams derived from the Project  applying a very conservative approach. The Project’s economic value is likely to be higher since the analysis did not include  other non-economic global and local benefits such as resulting improvements in food security.  
198,"55. The PIU will handle FM tasks with the support from UFI. Based on a simplified assessment of the FM  arrangements, the Bank concluded that the controls and systems that MARN has in place are adequate to administer  financial aspects of the proposed Project. MARN has relevant experience implementing WB-financed projects with  satisfactory FM performance and the FM staff are qualified. In addition, the PIU will be staffed with a well-seasoned  financial specialist hired under Terms of Reference (ToR) agreed with the WB. Like in a recent operation (FCPF REDD+  Readiness Preparation Project P124935), MARN will use the Financial Administration System (Sistema de Administración  Financiera Integrado, SAFI) to record financial transactions; and will maintain a set of subsidiary ledgers in excel  spreadsheets to prepare financial statements required by the Bank. The PIU will produce semi-annual interim unaudited  financial reports containing at least: (i) a statement of sources and uses of funds (with expenditures classified by  component and subcomponent) and cash balances; (ii) a statement of budget execution per component and  subcomponent; (iii) a reconciliation of the designated account (DA); and (iv) a simplified subproject statement. Annual  financial statements will be audited by a private firm under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The audit work  will be financed with grant proceeds. According to the Bank policy on Access to Information, audited financial statements  will be made public. "
199,"56. Project funds will be disbursed through advances to the DA, Direct Payments, and Reimbursement. A DA will be  opened at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, to be used exclusively for deposits and withdrawals of grant  proceeds for eligible expenditures. Funds deposited into the DA will follow Bank’s disbursement policies and procedures,  as described in the Disbursement and Financial Information Letter (DFIL). NGOs selected to implement activities under  Component 2 will be required to open and maintain a segregated account in a commercial bank to receive funds disbursed  by MARN for activities related to restorations and from which payments will be made. Specific procedures, including flow  of funds arrangements, documentation requirements and simplified format for the beneficiaries to reports on the use of  the funds, as well as supervision from MARN will be included in a simplified guidance. Finally, FM supervision will include  periodic review of unaudited Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), review of the Project’s audits, and biannual supervision  missions.  "
200,"57. Procurement arrangements. The Recipient will carry out procurement under the Project in accordance with the  WB’s “Procurement Regulations for IPF Borrowers” (Procurement Regulations) dated July 2016 and November 2020 60,  and with the provisions stipulated in the procurement plan and in the POM. Procurement activities will be carried out by  the PIU with the support of UACI. An initial assessment on the procurement capacity of the PIU was carried out and it is  concluded that the PIU will have the adequate capacity to carry out the Project. Among the fiduciary arrangements, the  PIU will include a procurement specialist in charge of the procurement processes and contract management. A simplified  Project Procurement Strategy for Development (PPSD) will be prepared to better define the appropriate procurement "

202,"arrangements, appropriate selection methods, market analysis approach, and type of review to be conducted by the Bank.  A procurement plan covering the initial 18 months of the Project has been prepared in accordance with the identified  needs to achieve the fulfillment of the objectives in accordance with the Procurement Plan and made available through  the Systematic Tracking of Exchanges in Procurement (STEP). Mandatory Procurement Prior Review Thresholds detailed  in Annex I of the Bank’s Procurement Policies will be followed. The main procurement activities will be centred around  consulting services and noncomplex goods. With regards to the Component 2, once the beneficiary subprojects are  selected as defined in the POM, such subprojects will follow the Procurement Regulations, if the project execution includes  the procurement of goods or services. Simplified procedures and standardized procurement documents for such  procurement activities will be agreed between the PIU and the Bank and attached to the POM.  "
203,"58. Fiduciary Risk. The fiduciary risk for this project has been assessed at moderate. The main risk is that 46 percent  of grant proceeds are expected to be executed through local NGOs which will implement activities related to technical  assistance for ecosystem restoration including procure and payment for agricultural inputs to be provided to farmers. The  mitigation measures included in the Project to ensure satisfactory performance of fiduciary functions include (i) an FM  section of the POM to ensure adequate contract management and monitoring mechanisms over project funds; (ii) a  simplified FM assessment of NGOs that are proposed to receive advances will be carried out by the Bank if the amount of  the grant exceeds US$200,000, and by the PIU for lower amounts; a template for the desk review should be included in  the POM; (iii) a simplified guidance for the NGO’s implementation of restoration activities under Component 2 should be  prepared and should be part of the NGO sub-grant agreements, including procedures for the flow of funds between PIU  and the NGO, internal controls, NGOs documentation of expenditures, etc.; and (iv) qualified fiduciary staff hired for  the PIU under ToR acceptable to the Bank.

206,"60. The overall environmental and social risk is considered substantial. The environmental risk is considered  moderate. Overall, the Project is expected to promote the adoption of more sustainable and resilient land-use practices  to contribute to the conservation of local and globally important ecosystems and biodiversity, reduce forest and soil  degradation, improve biodiversity conservation of gallery forest and mangroves, and adopt sustainable agricultural  practices in the sugarcane industry (including the reduction of agrochemical and pesticide use, improve water use, and  promote overall sustainable practices and technologies). Identified environmental risks and impacts include: (i) loss or  conversion of natural and semi-natural vegetated land to other types of land cover classes (if good practices in land "

209,"through reforestation and/or agroforestry activities; (iv) potential contamination due to the use of agrochemicals and  pesticides in sugar cane production, agroforestry and agro-silvo-pastoral systems; and (v) occupational health and safety  hazards for the workforce due to the careless use of machinery and equipment. Possible negative impacts are expected  to be site-specific, short-term, and reversible. "
210,"61. The social risk is considered substantial. While the overall social benefits are expected to be positive, identified  social risks and impacts include: i) project workers exposure to the COVID-19 virus and transmission to local communities;  ii) transmission of the virus within local communities and beneficiaries, especially during workshops; iii) economic  displacement due to access restrictions as part of Component 2 that could impact vulnerable and resource dependent  groups; iv) conflicts over competing interests and demands of different land and water users (in light of water scarcity);  v) the need to consider tradeoffs between different stakeholder interests and warrant off elite capture; vi) the presence  of crime and gang-violence in some areas, which can pose a threat to local communities and project workers and could  hinder the implementation of subprojects; and vii) possible exclusion of IPs from project benefits due to historical barriers  to access benefits, limited territorial connectivity, and lack of culturally sensitive engagements. No physical displacement  is envisaged under the Project. The Project will include elements to minimize exclusion risks and put a strong focus on  inclusive stakeholder engagement through the SEP, particularly regarding small producers, community/day/rotating  workers, migrant workers, women and youth. "
211,"62. Mitigation measures for the above-mentioned environmental and social risks are set out in the Environmental  and Social Management Framework (ESMF), which includes: a Process Framework (PF); a SEP; Labor Management  Procedures (LMP); Biodiversity Management Guidelines; an Integrated Pest Management Plan; an Integrated Waste  Management Plan; an Occupational Health and Safety Plan; a COVID-19 Response Plan; an Emergency Response Plan;  and, a Cultural Tangible and Intangible Heritage Management Procedure. The commitments from these instruments are  captured in the Environmental and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP) and include: i) comprehensive community and  workforce health and safety measures; ii) hazardous substances and pollution prevention measures; iii) waste  management measures; iv) biodiversity management considerations; v) labor and contract management procedures,  including the enforcement of codes of conduct, transparency; vi) inclusiveness and participation of beneficiaries in  designing and implementing the project activities; vii) communication and stakeholder engagement activities to continue  throughout project implementation; and viii) a grievance mechanism, covering both workers and project stakeholders at  large. The PIU will include one social specialist throughout project implementation. Advanced drafts of the ESMF, the  associated Environmental and Social risk management instruments listed above, and the ESCP have been prepared  by  MARN prior to Appraisal61. They were disclosed on April 12th, 2021. A detailed description of Environmental and Social  risks and impacts and a summary of proposed mitigation measures are included in the Environmental and Social Review  Summary (ESRS), also disclosed on April 12th, 2021. "
212,63. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected by a WB supported project may  submit complaints to existing project-level grievance redress mechanisms or the WB’s Grievance Redress Service (GRS).  The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address project-related concerns. Project  affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the WB’s independent Inspection Panel which

216,"64. The overall risk rating is Substantial. Key risks include (i) environmental and social, (ii) stakeholders; (iii)  other: health security, and (iv) other: climate change.  "
217,65. Environmental and social: Substantial. This is mostly due to social risks (see Section V.D for details on  risks and mitigation measures). 
218,"66. Stakeholders: Substantial. Violence is still widespread in the country, and conflicts might arise among  stakeholders in the project implementation area. A significant challenge arises in working with diverse  stakeholders in the region. Tensions persist between communities and sugar cane producers due to water usage  and the expansion of sugar cane fields. Consequently, critical stakeholders (farmers) could oppose the proposed  changes and deny the project interventions and support. As a mitigation strategy, building on the FCPF REDD+  Readiness Preparation Project, MARN will continue a board consultation process involving various sectors and  working in the regional multi-stakeholder environment. The MRdR will allow stakeholders to be represented,  creating an instance for collaboration with the MARN and MAG guidance. Also, partial funding of restoration  activities will stimulate stakeholders’ willingness to participate in the project interventions. "
219,"67. Other – COVID-19 pandemic: Substantial. The COVID-19 outbreak is not yet controlled and there are  lingering impacts. Movement restrictions may reduce fieldwork and stakeholder participation; limitations in  response to the pandemic may affect populations’ livelihoods, increasing pressure on natural resources and land;  the GoES might shift resources to health and economic departments. While the outbreak could be better  contained by the time the Project starts, early in 2022, its evolution actually remains uncertain62. As a mitigation  measure, COVID-19 risk assessments and guidelines were developed and revised in direct coordination with the  GoES’ health agencies and following the Bank’s guidance. These will be updated periodically during project  implementation. In addition, by strengthening forest landscapes and ecosystem services, the proposed project  would be strengthening forests as a safety net for vulnerable rural population, as forests are sources of food,  water, income, nutritional diversity, health, fiber, and energy for vulnerable rural population. The ecological  recovery this project proposes would also contribute to enhancing the resilience of key sectors of the economy  such as sugarcane, basic grains, and cacao by promoting best practices for land restoration and integrating  compensation for environmental services. "
220,68. Other – Climate Change: Substantial. The targeted landscape is exposed to climate-induced extreme

223,"weather events, which are likely to be exacerbated by climate change (See Section 1. A, para 2). Related events  could affect stakeholder participation, project implementation, and development outcomes. As a mitigation  measure, a Climate Risk Assessment guided the project design.63 The sustainable agricultural practices promoted  by the Project will contribute to building resilience to the impacts of climate change by maintaining the essential  functions of the forest ecosystems, underpinning rural livelihoods subsistence and key sectors of the economy  such as agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure. Also, sustainable management of natural resources through an  integrated landscape approach will help protect ecosystems and people’s exposure to weather and physical  conditions caused by climate change. This is consistent with the country’s mitigation-based adaptation approach  reflected in the NDC, which poses agriculture and water among the priority areas for climate action to promote  climate change adaptation.

291,"1. Unplanned expansion of sugar cane and basic grain crops coupled with unsustainable production practices  are degrading land and ecosystems across the landscape, including mangroves and riparian forests, and are also  degrading biodiversity (including in agriculture ecosystems), as well as soil within farms, reducing their  productivity and sustainability. Sugar cane expansion has also resulted in the direct conversion of mangrove  forests, and the displacement of traditional crops to higher mountain areas, which are consequently degraded  and affect the provision of hydrological services for the overall country’s economy, and particularly for sugarcane  crops themselves. Also, coffee agroforestry systems, which constitute an important area of the country’s forest  cover and provide critical ecosystem services, are being degraded or replaced by pasture or crops without shade,  further degrading and deforesting the landscape. Solutions to this problem are constrained by (i) high vulnerability  to climate change and extreme weather events, especially droughts and floods, that prompt farmers to deforest  new land; (ii) limited incentives to implement sustainable production practices that mainstream biodiversity  conservation and prevent land degradation; (iii) lack of institutional capacities and financial resources to manage  ecosystem services at the landscape scale, including insufficient coordination between environmental and  agricultural policies; (iv) perverse incentives with a focus on productivity and excess use of fertilizers; and (v)  reduced opportunities for off-farm employment (exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic). "
292,"2. To address this issue, the proposed Project will work at a landscape scale to generate the enabling  conditions for integrated landscape management, pilot improved management practices, and promote  restoration of degraded lands and ecosystems. It will also engage the private sector to adopt sustainable  production practices and invest in the conservation and restoration of ecosystems, targeting small farmers and  communities. The Project will strengthen governance and technical capacities to manage natural resources at the  landscape scale by enhancing coordination of public institutions, particularly between the MARN, the MAG and  municipalities; and by generating technical capacities to mainstream biodiversity conservation and land  degradation considerations in natural resources management decisions and policies. It will also promote private  financial mechanisms to restore degraded lands and preserve ecosystem services by working with sugar cane  producers who benefit from ecosystem services generated upstream, where healthy coffee agroforestry systems  and gallery forests are key for biodiversity conservation and water provision and regulation. Additionally, technical  assistance will be provided to landscape dwellers to help them adopt SLM practices that mainstream biodiversity  conservation and LDN criteria, improving ecosystems’ connectivity and reducing soil erosion at the farm level. The  combined actions are expected to generate the financial and institutional conditions to ensure the sustainability  of restoration and conservation efforts over time, contributing to reinforce the conservation of critical biodiversity  and ecosystems, improve the provision of ecosystem services across the landscape and especially in downstream  areas, and upgrade the resilience of local communities to climate change and natural disasters.  "
293,"3. The success of these activities in achieving the ultimate outcomes will be dependent on the following  assumptions: (i) The agricultural producers in the project area, and critically sugarcane producers, will be willing  to engage in activities and governance bodies (such as the MRdR); (ii) the area will not face a significant outbreak  of violence on top of the present security conditions; (iii) the relevant policies and programs established by the  GoES will remain stable; and (iv) COVID-19 pandemic restrictions will cease, allowing for fieldwork.

296,"1. El Salvador has a long history of anthropogenic intervention and land-use change in its territory,  composed of intricate mosaics that include forest patches, coffee farms, pasture, bushes, subsistence crops,  and sugarcane, among others, while the remaining area of natural ecosystems is limited. Land use is dominated  by agriculture. Approximately 60 percent of the territory is used for agricultural production, and farms cover 80  percent of the land area in a diverse agriculture-forest-landscape64 (See Figure 3)65. Despite a decrease in the rate  of forest loss in recent years, from 2001 to 2018, El Salvador lost 74,400 ha of tree cover, equivalent to a 7.5  percent decrease in tree cover since 200066. This places the country as the second most deforested in Latin  America. Deforestation has also affected the country’s coastal and marine forest resources: in the last five  decades, the country lost 60 percent of its mangroves, passing from almost 100,000 ha to only 40,000 ha67.  According to the 2018 National Forest Inventory, 38.8 percent of the country is covered by forests. However, most  of those forests are secondary (58 percent) and agroforestry systems of shade coffee (21 percent), and there is  important fragmentation of forest ecosystems. Despite recent efforts to improve environmental sustainability  and restore degraded land, land-use change remains a severe problem in the country as it drives land degradation  and threatens biodiversity.

299,"2. Agriculture makes a significant contribution to El Salvador’s GDP and is an essential employment source,  but its productivity is relatively low. In 2016, the agriculture sector contributed 12 percent of the country’s GDP,  and 19 percent of the employed population is engaged in agriculture, fishing, and hunting. In rural areas, that  number rises to 43 percent, and agricultural activities constitute the primary source of income68. Due to its high  levels of independent and informal workforce, this sector is especially vulnerable to the effects of the quarantines  and macroeconomic disturbances provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsistence agriculture is practiced by  350,000 producers in farms of less than three hectares and steep terrains, dominated by low productivity corn  crops. Most family farms do not participate in producer associations. Only 8 percent have access to credit, and 10  percent have access to technical assistance69. Coffee is the main product in terms of GDP contribution, but others  such as sugar cane are rapidly growing. The agricultural sector receives direct and indirect incentives, which often  contradict the environmental commitments and objectives El Salvador has established in recent years.  "
300,"3. Sugar cane expansion, crop, and harvest practices have been identified as one of the main current  threats to Salvadorian ecosystems. Located mostly on the lower western and central lands, sugar cane  plantations have spread into the country’s coastal territories. They are primarily responsible for the clearing of  mangroves and riparian forests. From 2006 to 2015, sugar cane plantations increased from approximately 60,000  to 80,000 ha. The country’s Fifth Biodiversity Report found that 48,280 ha of deforestation between 2000 and  2010 were due to the expansion of sugarcane plantations70. In terms of land degradation, unsustainable  agricultural practices such as burning crops before harvest, heavy usage of herbicides and pesticides, and poor  wastewater management practices generate soil erosion and mangroves’ siltation, importantly affecting  biodiversity. Erosion of soils and sedimentation of water leads to lower productivity rates, which farmers tend to  compensate for by further expanding their agricultural area into mangrove, ecotones areas, and gallery forests71.  Mangroves serve as an essential nursery habitat for fisheries and are rich in biodiversity and play an important  role in coastal communities by protecting shorelines from storm and hurricane winds, waves, and floods72.  Pressure on ecosystems may be accentuated in sugarcane and other crop areas because of the COVID-19  pandemic if unemployed workers return to rural areas or if the GoES increases assistance to secure food security  and employment. "
301,"4. In turn, land degradation affects the agricultural sector and increases the vulnerability of rural  communities. Land degradation and soil erosion, exacerbated by recurrent flood and drought, adversely impact  agrarian production, further affecting the rural poor’s livelihoods. The National Development Plan (2014)  identifies natural disasters as one of the greatest threats to human development, with a disproportionate impact  on the poor in combination with other factors like environmental degradation73. Losses in infrastructure, crop  production, and water supply caused by extreme rainfall events and droughts since 2009 has affected the  economy by almost 1 percent74.  "

Despite the development of multi-stakeholder dialog supported by rigorous analysis to advance  restoration efforts, agricultural policies often contradict environmental objectives and commitments. MAG  regulates land use planning for water, land, and forestry uses through the DGFCR. These institutions often provide  direct and indirect support to both large scale and subsistence scale producers that do not consider environmental  elements. "
306,"6. Restoring ecosystems and landscapes to guarantee sustainable livelihoods is a national priority. To  address the environmental sustainability challenges it faces, El Salvador is committed to reverse the degradation  process by setting ambitious targets to restore degraded land and mainstream biodiversity across the agricultural  and forestry sectors. The main components of the 2012 National Environmental Policy are the restoration and  conservation of ecosystems to reduce risks while sustaining productive activities and ensuring the well-being of  the population. Within this framework, the PREP was developed in synergy with key biodiversity, environmental,  water and sanitation, and climate change strategies. The PREP is already being translated into action: MARN has  been working with different partners to design and implement instruments to strengthen and prioritize PREP  actions. The PREP applies the ROAM to determine and analyze restoration options based on biophysical, social,  and economic criteria75. As a result, restoration actions have been implemented in 241,662 ha of degraded land  across the country in the 2014-2019 period76. Under a coordinated and synergistic approach, in El Salvador,  restoration initiatives are contributing to recover and conserve biodiversity, rehabilitating degraded lands,  supporting the climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, and advancing towards Goal 15 of Aichi of  the Convention on Biological Diversity. "
307,"7. To reduce land degradation and restore degraded land, El Salvador updated the PANSAL and has  developed an ambitious National Restoration Plan. El Salvador is committed to LDN, and it will be a pilot country  in the implementation of the LDN Framework under the UNCCD. The country is updating the PANSAL, developing  a national strategy, country objectives, and voluntary targets that align with this project to achieve this objective.  Moreover, as part of the Bonn Challenge, the country pledged to restore one million hectares of land by 203077.  The MARN presented in 2017 the National REDD+ EN-REP to meet its ecosystem restoration commitments. The  EN-REP aims at restoring the ecosystem functions of the country’s degraded lands to reduce the loss and damage  caused by natural and climate-related disaster risks; increase the country’s carbon stocks and capture rate; pursue  sustainable economic activities and protected infrastructure investments; and ensure the overall well-being of  the population. In the same year, the MARN launched the 2018-2022 National Ecosystem Restoration Plan, which  includes an economic analysis of the actions for the restoration of landscapes and promotes improved agricultural  practices that reduce land degradation. "
308,"8. A PDLS aims to improve coordination at the regional level and guide new investments on restoration  efforts in the Conservation Areas. The PDLS are developed using Miradi’s open standards methodology78. Each  PDLS has two areas of work: (i) the protection, increase and restoration of forest ecosystems to ensure ecosystem  services, conserve biodiversity, and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and increase of  carbon reserves, and (ii) the transformation of traditional productive systems into agroecological or sustainable  systems that contribute to improving the quality of life for the human population. The methodology for planning  and implementing restoration actions follows four stages: (i) a participatory and inclusive analysis of the region’s  vulnerability and environmental degradation, to identify priority issues to be addressed; (ii) identify priority sites "

FUNDAZUCAR and CONSAA began in 2012 the process of building the sustainability strategy of the sugar  agroindustry, aiming to achieve a more sustainable and resilient agriculture. FUNDAZUCAR developed a Manual  of Good Practices79, which integrates environment criteria (including green harvest techniques), with a  perspective to progressively adopt a territorial approach (i.e., water basin) and to contribute to comply with the  country’s SDG commitments. The manual was developed with support from GIZ, IDB, and FUNDEMAS. More  recently, the sugar cane industry started to certify its sustainability under the Bonsucro International Standard80.  "

The land’s topography is mostly flat in the south, increasing  altitude progressively towards the north, reaching a peak of 1844 meters. About 41 percent of the tree cover  (28,690 ha) is in conservation areas, concentrated in southern mangroves, and dispersed as patches in the north.  Annual precipitation ranges between 1455 and 1918 mm, with most rain concentrated in the north, feeding into  the water basins’ high areas.  "

The pressure of recent droughts and extreme weather events that lead to landslides combined with these  factors to exacerbate land degradation. Meanwhile, in the lower elevations, traditional cultures have been lost to  sugarcane, which is implemented at medium and large scales, and requires unique management approaches. The  region is characterized for containing an entire water basin and connecting the practices of subsistence basic grain  producers with sugarcane producers through water, requiring an integrated landscape management approach.

Component 1 will be implemented across the entire landscape, focusing  on the municipalities of San Pedro Puxtla, Guaymango, Jujutla, San Francisco Menéndez, and Ataco. Component  2 will be implemented in the municipalities of Acajutla, San Francisco Menéndez, and Jujutla. These areas have  been prioritized considering water recharge areas, riparian forests, and biological corridors. Similarly, areas in and  around sugar cane plantation in the lower basin and coastal municipalities were prioritized on crop areas with  degraded lands and targeting those close to fragile ecosystems.

These will be implemented at regional and local levels and promote the involvement of private  institutions such as NGOs, universities, and companies, to support the limited capacities of CENTA in the region.  Collaboration with MAG will improve coordination between ministries for land-use planning, landscape, and  ecosystem restoration (including PREP), as well as technology transfer activities. Local governments  (municipalities) involvement in planning restoration will be promoted through local environmental governance  instances and the collaboration with NGOs.

This activity will promote the participation of vulnerable  populations such as women, young and indigenous communities. The actions to be financed include: (i) the  operations of the COAL and the Ramsar committee; (ii) implementing an education plan (developed separately,  see paragraph 25) for water boards participants, to provide them with knowledge of restoration and sustainable  practices (including CES, governance for climate resilience, and adaptive management), and highlight the role of  women and indigenous communities in landscape management; (iii) diverse technical support for environmental  governance in the region, promoting the participation of public institutions and NGOs; and (iv) updating a PLAS  and producing two new ones in Barra de Santiago, Metalio and Garita Palmera, to guide family-scale sustainable  practices for the extraction of non-timber products from mangrove forests.  "
330,"17. The Project will also contribute to the design, implementation, coordination, and technical assistance of  the MRdR and the private sector forum. The MRdR will be established through COAL, for the Ahuachapán  Coordination area or a Restauration RoundTable, and will liaise with the Ahuachapán Coordination Roundtable,  which incorporates relevant national institutions and international agencies that implement projects in the area  (e.g., GIZ, UNDP and IUCN), by relying on advice from it and, through it, building synergies with other projects in  the area. Similarly, it will be supported by the Roundtable of Irrigators from Ahuachapán, which integrates the  local water boards to manage water resources. The MRdR will integrate representatives of MARN, MAG (including  CENTA and DGFCR), institutions driving other local projects (e.g., FIAES, UNDP, FAO), and the relevant local  instances for each selected basin or Municipality. New alliances and improved coordination will be pursued  between local water boards and the private sector actors intervening in the landscape (mainly sugar cane  producers), promoting investments in the conservation of water recharge and important biodiversity areas.  "
331,"18. Creating awareness among the public and especially the agricultural producer in the area is considered a  key step for the Project’s successful implementation. To achieve this, the valuation of local ecosystem services  and examples of successful CES projects will be studied and communicated. A consultant will study the benefits  of ecosystem services for the population in the area, positive restoration actions carried out in the past, and their  impacts of degradation. Communication of this information through an environmental education plan will aim to  increase awareness on the contribution of ecosystem services to the rural and IP’s subsistence and culture, as  well as the relevance of participative and inclusive governance. This plan will finance the preparation and  dissemination of information about SLM practices, restoration, the value of ecosystem services, land tenure  security and related gender equality issues. This activity includes (i) preparing a study of the economic value of  ecosystem services and the benefits of successful restoration projects; (ii) developing a communication plan for  the results of the study; (iii) providing capacities for local communication agents; (iv) preparing graphical  promotional products; and (v) implementing the campaign through local and regional media.

Diagnosis includes information on hydrological status,  identification of species that historically develop at the site,  and whether they can be established naturally when  recovering their hydrological conditions. The first step is to  restore the natural hydrology of the site and then observe if it  is necessary to propagate plants, as long as it is verified that it  has not been possible to insert them naturally.

Understand the normal hydrological patterns that control the distribution,  establishment, and successful growth of target mangrove species; 3. Evaluate the barriers preventing natural  recover of mangroves. 4. Select restoration areas with potential success by applying the previous steps,  considering available resources and labor, as well as solution to property and land use issues, to ensure ownership;  5.

The planning process builds on relevant studies and data on population  and morphometric characteristics, carried out with the participation of local stakeholders (puncheros and  curileros); it also utilizes information from inventories of the harvesting and fishing practices and gear used by the  communities, as well as the curileros and puncheros, which specify the species used by each one of them. In this  process, it is of utmost importance to establish agreements to promote sustainable use of resources among  communities. These agreements address the spatio-temporal regulation of activities to achieve established goals  of mangrove protection, management, and use, defining the permitted sizes and maximum allowable numbers,  and adopting zoning guidelines and, on some occasions, closed periods. This planning process aim at achieving a  meaningful involvement of local stakeholders in sustainable use of mangrove, while supporting their livelihoods. "

379,"1. Differences in gender roles in rural communities have led male and female jobs to have considerably different  wages, leadership, and safety conditions. El Salvador has made significant efforts to recognize and advance women’s  rights by signing and ratifying major international treaties and including them in domestic legislation. However,  improvements in the legal framework have not resulted in comparable progress in gender equality of endowments, such  as health, education, economic opportunities, family dynamics, voice, and agency. Females also face limited  participation in rural organizations and access to land. In addition, males are significantly more likely to migrate than  females. Females in households that receive remittances have lower labor force participation rates, making young  women dependent on income support from male partners living abroad (remittances)83.  "
380,  (a) Gender analysis in agricultural and forestry productive sectors 
381,"2. In rural El Salvador, women’s economic empowerment and participation in economic activities are challenged  by land rights, meaningful involvement in unpaid activities, and low access to education. Women often do not obtain  or enjoy the benefits of their participation in agricultural production, which partly leads them to rely on additional  income and take care of other responsibilities (household chores, family care, food, etc.). In addition to attending to  household chores, many rural women perform unpaid work alongside men on farms and livestock farms: planting,  weeding, harvesting, raising livestock, feeding, and caring for sick animals, as well as cooking for other agricultural  workers. Some women also work outside the home making clothes, or as employees or owners of specific stores (such  as supermarkets or kiosks), or as administrative assistants, among other activities.    3. The gender gap is present throughout the life cycle of women and men, reflected in indicators that measure  choices and opportunities, including health, education, labor, seats in parliament, time employment, and social  protection. Overall, there are more men in poverty (35 percent) than women (32 percent). An analysis of equity  relationships in water use and management in rural populations in southern Ahuachapán84 indicates; 368 men (88.67  percent) and 47 women (11.33 percent) from different parts of the Basin of the Cara Sucia-San Pedro watershed are  engaged in forestry and agro-silvo-pastoral activities85. The water distribution service’s property by basin areas,  disaggregated by sex, showed 43 percent women and 57 percent men86. Regarding water use, women use it mainly for  domestic work and personal grooming, with an average consumption of 408 liters per year. In contrast, men use it for  personal grooming and agriculture, consuming 117 liters per year.’ "

433,"1. The WB incorporates GHG emission accounting for all investment project financing since 2012, and GEF projects  are included in this standard. Emission reductions are increasingly relevant for mitigating climate change and can only  be effectively managed if GHG emissions are quantified and monitored. The bank adopted EX-ACT as the default tool  for quantifying GHG emissions related to agriculture, reforestation, and land use. The tool was developed by the FAO  in 2010 to assess the impact of agricultural investment lending on GHG emissions and carbon sequestration. EX-ACT  allows the assessment of a project’s net carbon-balance, defined as the net balance of CO2 equivalent that was emitted  or sequestered because of project implementation compared to a without project scenario. It then estimates the  carbon stock changes (emissions or sinks), expressed in equivalent tons of CO2 per hectare and year, including  uncertainties (See Tables 9 and 10). "
434,"2. This GEF project aims at promoting improved agricultural practices and restoring degraded landscapes in EIBSCA.  It is designed to support the sustainable management of basins and retain the provision of ecosystem services, while  improving productive economic activities for basic grains, cacao and sugarcane based on improved and integrated  management of water and soil. The EX-ACT v8.5.4 tool was used to assess the GHG impacts associated with the  investment activities. "
435,"3. Project boundaries. The GHG accounting analysis considers activities under Component 2. Although Component  1 will create enabling conditions that will promote improved landscape management, which are expected to reduce  emissions, these are not measurable. Specifically, the CES agreements under Component 1 will likely reduce emissions,  and potentially increase carbon sequestration, but these are not yet defined and therefore, were excluded from the  analysis. On the other hand, Component 2 will restore and improve practices in 930 ha, restore further 70 ha, and  produce demonstrative plots for sugarcane and other cultures. Moreover, support for the implementation of  BONSUCRO 5.1 practices in sugarcane fields is expected to reach at least half (3.300 ha) of the land managed by farmers  that already demonstrated interest. Other activities will not be included since there is no set goal expected to be  reached. For example, capacity building activities and awareness campaigns are expected to increase the uptake of  sustainable management practices across the landscape, but the effects are hard to predict.  "
436,"  4. Basic assumptions. Soil type was selected as Low Activity Clay based on FAO’s EX ACT maps, which is the dominant  soil type in area. The project's implementation period is five years, and the capitalization of the investments were  calculated for 15 years after project completion, thus, the GHG analysis was conducted for a 20-year period. The  “without project scenario” is assumed to be equal to a “no project scenario” or “business-as-usual”. This default  assumption is deemed reasonable as changes in agricultural activity crucially depend on information, knowledge, and  technology available to beneficiaries, which are expected contributions of the Project. "
437,"5. Inputs to the analysis. The project interventions will directly target an estimated area of 1,020 ha, including  restoration and adoption of improved production practices on 520 ha of basic grains agroforestry and 140 ha of cacao  agroforestry in the upper watershed, 20 ha of sugarcane plantations and 200 ha of agro-silvo-pastoral production.  Agro-silvo-pastoral practices are expected to be extended to 2,000 heads of cattle. The improvements include  sustainable management of soil (tillage, nutrient application), selection of improved genetic material, and agroforestry  linked to sustainable cacao production. It also considers the restoration of 50 ha of gallery forests and 30 ha of  mangrove forests. Indirectly a much larger area is expected to be improved through capacity building, implementing  BONSUCRO certification for sugarcane, raising awareness across small-scale farmers, and demonstrative activities.

445,support to transition to reach an Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration in targeted areas of the 
446,seven municipalities. The land areas would continue on a decreasing track of ecosystem health and sustainability 
447,of the agriculture and cattle ranching that would lead to further pressure on the agriculture frontier; conventional 
448,agricultural practices would continue to low tree cover on productive lands and thus limited capacity to absorb 
449,carbon; a limited number of sustainable forest operations would be incorporated into the economic activities of 
450,"local communities; and, therefore, land-use conversion would remain subject to agricultural activities with "
451,"2. For this analysis, a “business-as-usual” baseline case is used that assumes that future development trends "
452,"follow those of the past and no changes in policies and practices will take place. In developing countries, land-use "
453,"patterns are changing quickly, so in this analysis as well, it is more relevant to use recent past trends than long-"
454,"term past trends. Thus, this analysis uses recent trends of long-term trends as the recent changes seem to be "
455,3. The Project creates additionality by: (i) enhancing the social and natural capital in the project sites; (ii) 
456,fostering the transformation and value aggregation of economic activities through strengthening building 
457,"capacities to promote restoration and sustainable management of natural resources; (iii) linking local, regional, "
458,"and federal actors to producer groups to derive benefits of information and knowledge exchange of biodiversity, "
459,"sustainable productive practices, and related legislation and programs to incremental benefits strengthen both "
460,"environmental and the beneficiary farmer’s capacities for productivity improvements, especially for producers of "
461,4. The GEF incremental support would assist the El Salvador in strengthening the improved landscape 
462,"management and restoration of degraded lands with sustainable practices, and it is long-term economic and "
463,"financial sustainability. The government budget is limited, but the Project will support alternative instruments to "
464,"overcome any further limitation, involving new cross-sectoral actors to address policies related to integrated "
465,"landscape management. Without the Project, the budget forecast to be allocated for conservation of land areas "
466,by the GoES (baseline scenario) would be limited. The proposed GEF investment would leverage additional 
467,resources from other partners over the same period. This financing will help develop the necessary institutional 
468,"capabilities, set up policy frameworks for sustainable productive areas, and develop mechanisms for sustainable "
469,"5. To simplify the incremental economic analysis of the Project, assumptions were used taking account the "
470,possible benefits in the project sites. The Project is expected to provide three economic benefit streams: (i) 
471,"ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits provided by Integrated Landscape Management, (ii) carbon storage "
472,"and sequestration by sustainable practices and restoration, and (iii) mangrove restoration and activities at "
473,"producer level, enabling them to transit to sustainable management activities that have positive social and private "
474,  The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration (P170854)

476,the third benefit is most associated with Component 1.  
477,"6. Ecosystem services and Biodiversity benefit stream. For this stream, improved sustainable practices "
478,provide many ecosystem services that are necessary for social and economic wellbeing. These services include 
479,"water filtration and storage, cleaning air, soil formation, recreation, food, and timber.91 Much of the El Salvador "
480,"state’s economy depends on the natural, resources, products, and productive activities developed in the "
481,"watersheds/basins. To estimate the benefits associated to this benefit stream, the total hectares of landscapes "
482,under improved sustainable practices intervened by the Project are considered as defined in the Results 
483,"Framework. It is assumed that the total area and is based on the triangular distribution92 for five project years, "
484,"that is, the Project divided by 15 to obtain the factor that is each year added to the growth of the previous year "

498,It is estimated that 0.2 tons/ha/year will be avoided in the total area intervened in the Project (including the 
499,"reduction of degradation, loss of ecosystems, and sustainable productive practices) over 20 years.  "
500,9. Monetary values were estimated based on the carbon social price.96Here it is used US$60 t/C as an upper 
501,"bound and US$40 t/Carbon as a lower bound. Additionally, the value of voluntary carbon market US$3.01 "
502,"t/Carbon, which do not include that social part, was added in the analysis as an alternative case.97 According to "
503,"the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices, it is recommended that the Project’s economic analysis use a low "
504,and high estimate of the carbon price and take a value that is consistent with achieving the core objective of the 
505,"Paris Agreement of keeping temperature rise below 2 degrees. Therefore, a higher value (US$60) was taken as an "

507,"to investments on improved/sustainable productive practices for coffee, cacao, sugar cane, and basic grain "
508,"producer groups as well as agro-silvo-pastoral and agroforestry systems, and mangrove restoration. Therefore, "
509,"these activities supported under each component bring social, financial, and environmental benefits. The benefit "
510,of producer groups activities is found by comparing the situation with and without the Project.  
511,"11. In simple terms, there are two ways to assess economically this benefit stream: (i) estimating the "
512,difference of benefits between conventional (current or baseline scenario) and regenerative production practices 
513,"(sustainable practice scenario), or (ii) taking a percentage that represents an improvement in benefits for adopting "

516,"regenerative production practices compared to conventional. In this sense, for this economic analysis, it is "
517,considered an increase in their productivity by at least 10 percent.  
518,"12. There are five types of activities to be financed at the producer level: (a) cacao, (b) basic grains, (c) sugar "
519,"cane production, (d) agro-silvo-pastoral system, and (e) gallery forests. In addition to this, mangroves restoration "
520,is included as one more activity in the total intervened areas. These six activities were chosen because they are 
521,related to the sustainable management of land use. Figure 10 shows the distribution of land-use types and their

525,"13. The economic value of these six types of selected activities is obtained from a national study of financial,  environmental, and social benefits of nine restoration actions that are part of the Action Plan for Restoration of  Ecosystems and Landscapes of El Salvador, in compliance with the country’s commitment in the framework of the  Bonn Challenge to restore one million ha98. It is one of the first economic analyzes of the restoration actions  completed under the ROAM framework.    14. Specifically, these economic values were obtained from different agricultural products of El Salvador,  considering their characteristic benefits and costs. The social annual flows (which include both, social and private  returns) for all the economic activities assessed are taken from Raes et al. (2017).99 Here it was taken the values  of Cacao Production Activities (US$25,984/ha/year), Agro-silvo-pastoral system (US$ 20,275/ha/year), Mangrove  Restoration (US$6,906/ha/year). The values for basic grains, gallery forests and sugar cane production activities  do not show a significant change in the eleven-year period of the study; however, they could present an increase  of the benefits in a much longer period.

It is also assumed there are  no further incremental changes of project-generated benefits beyond the 20-year project evaluation period.  While the project costs are only assumed to emerge for the five years of project implementation, the benefits and  opportunity costs are assumed to be generated beyond the implementation period. Project costs over the  implementation period are approximated considering the project financing of US$ 3.56 million by GEF. Also, an  assumption of two percent, as an additional operating cost, were added along with the projection of a 20-year  project evaluation that will be added for the incremental economic analysis.  "
529,"16. A sensitivity analysis is applied for the main simulation parameters, notably the discount rate and project "
530,"horizon, to assess project robustness. For the discount rate, alternative rates of six and nine percent are applied. "
531,"In addition to varying discount rates, simulation results are tested against changing the project horizon (10 and 20 "
532,years). This set of sensitivity assessments enables a comprehensive analysis of the economic robustness of the

All the case scenarios are positive  suggesting that the Project creates more benefits than costs. At the same time, increasing the discount rate from  six to nine percent, reducing the carbon social price by 33 percent (from US$60 to US$40) as well as adopting the  value of voluntary carbon market (US$ 3.01) and using more conservative estimates regarding the value of  ecosystem services provided (upper bound and lower bound), do not substantially affect the estimates.

This incremental economic analysis for the Project in El Salvador shows substantial benefits for  beneficiaries in areas served by the Project, as well as substantial benefits for the Salvadoran society. Overall, the  NPV is projected to reach US$ 4.4 million (lower bound), and US$ 5.1 million (upper bound) in the baseline scenario  (20 years, carbon social price of US$ 60, and 6 percent discount rate). The investments evaluated for the economic  and financial analysis will generate a Benefit-Cost ratio between 2.18 and 2.37; and an IRR between 23 percent  and 25 percent. The economic and financial analysis thus shows that if Project implementation is effective and  efficient, Project-supported investments will bring substantial financial and economic benefits to small-scale farm  producers in the Project area and to Salvadoran society in general. "
542,"19. The results of the quantitative simulations are robust in terms of sensitivity analyses, assuming different  project years and discount rates, varying Benefit-Cost ratio between 1.16 and 2.37, and an IRR between 15 percent  and 25 percent. Throughout the analysis, the benefit assumptions were based on the values of ecosystem services  and carbon sequestration in El Salvador by recognized studies. "
543,"20. Estimates shown correspond to a lower bound as they represent the benefit streams derived from  Components 1 and 2 applying a very conservative approach. The economic value of project is likely to be higher  since the analysis did not include in the calculations other non-economic global and local benefits such as the  value of the resulting improvement in food security, among other benefits. Certainly, it is expected that  Component 3 will have additional benefits, but they are difficult to measure due to the social and environmental  qualitative approach, based on project management. Worth noting, this last component is needed to carry out  the main components and the overall project activities efficiently to thus achieving the desired results through  the strengthening of business skills for sustainable rural production and the project coordination, monitoring, and  evaluation.
