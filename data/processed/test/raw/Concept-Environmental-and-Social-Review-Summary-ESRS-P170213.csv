6,Proposed Development Objective(s)  To leverage financial resources and improve capacity to implement the Biodiversity Economy and increase benefits  from selected PA landscapes to local communities.
7,"B. Is the project being prepared in a Situation of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraints, as per Bank IPF  Policy, para. 12? No"
8,"C. Summary Description of Proposed Project [including overview of Country, Sectoral & Institutional Contexts and  Relationship to CPF]  The project will put forth a new PA management model, comprising of the following key characteristics:  • Mobilize new sources of finance. The project will leverage new sources of finance to support viable  biodiversity economy businesses to emerge among local communities in PA landscapes, also increasing the benefits  deriving from PAs. It will achieve such goal by establishing and capitalizing a Biodiversity Economy Fund (BEF)  dedicated to the above-mentioned purposes. The project will also consider leveraging existing initiatives created with "

11,"compatible objectives, such as the Green Outcome Fund  and the Tourism Conservation Fund . The project will also  seek potential sources of financing domestically, including from Treasury, national, provincial and local government  departments and agencies, and targeted PAs agencies’ budget, consequently contributing to redirect domestic  resources towards socio-economic development outcomes.  • Catalyze public and private sector resources. The project will forge strategic partnerships with key  stakeholders from governmental departments, to NGOs and the private sector, helping build the bridge between  currently unrealized but potentially viable business opportunities at the community/household level and the private  sector, while also fostering the development of market-driven, inclusive value chains around PAs landscapes. The  project will set up a mechanism to unlock access to finance and markets for businesses in rural landscapes around  PAs, by establishing a Launchpad tool which will map private sector operators active in targeted PA landscapes, their  interest in making their value chain more sustainable by partnering with local communities, and their jobs and  services’ needs (more details about the Launchpad will be found in Component 2). Actors which the project will link  up to include: Tourism Conservation Fund, Airbnb , concessions holders in and around PAs, philanthropy, actors  within the game and fisheries industry, and impact investors.  • Increase benefits from PAs to local communities. The project will put forth a mechanism to significantly  increase benefits to local communities, and consequently contribute to change their attitudes towards PAs and its  valuable biodiversity. This mechanism will include:  i) Support to biodiversity economy businesses: The project will increase benefits from PAs to communities by  setting up a system to help them develop business capacities, linkages with finance and markets, while also ensuring  these businesses are compatible with biodiversity conservation. The types of businesses that the project will promote  are mainly the following: i) tourism: hospitality, marketing, tourism activities, services to the tourism industry (chefs,  electricity technicians, etc.); ii) game ranching: animal husbandry, veterinary services, game processing, etc.; iii) forest  products: commercial forestry, veld and non-timber forest products; iv) agriculture: agronomy, post-harvest  management, processing and commercialization; v) business services: IT (consulting, services, software development  and programming); (vi) financial services (including insurance brokers, accounting and tax consultant firms); and  advertising, communications and marketing; vii) economic activities mostly relevant for women;  ii) Establishment and delivery of PES to reward positive behaviors towards the environment: PES aim to  stimulate behavior compatible with conservation goals, such as sustainable land management practices and reduced  poaching through cash payments normally at the household level (but sometimes also at community level) against  measured performance. The project will pilot such a mechanism to reward the adoption of sustainable land and  wildlife uses.  iii) More inclusive PA management. By supporting multi-stakeholders, multi-sectoral forums and governance  mechanisms for enhanced coordination and efficiency in achieving sustainability outcomes, the project will also  ensure that management of PAs, including land use planning decisions, will include a more active participation of local  communities living in the targeted PA landscapes. "
12,"D. Environmental and Social Overview D.1. Project location(s) and salient characteristics relevant to the ES assessment [geographic, environmental, social] The project will be implemented in the landscapes around iSimangaliso Wetland Park and Kruger National Park (KNP).  These two PA have the potential to rapidly scale up ongoing activities and demonstrate the application of the  proposed “hubs” of rural development model. The choice of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, in addition, will enable to "

15,"build on results and lessons learned from a recently closed World Bank project  that focused on protecting the  exceptional biodiversity of the Park though conservation, sustainable resources use, rational land use planning, and  local economic development. The choice of KNP, part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area, will  allow to leverage its ground-breaking achievements in terms of biodiversity conservation, environmental education,  sustainable tourism and local development promotion, and it will also allow for positive externalities deriving from  strengthened transfrontier cooperation. SANParks is currently identifying a third PA landscape, following a robust  selection process. "
16,"KNP is the largest protected area in South Africa and comprises almost 20,000 km2 in the provinces of Limpopo and  Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa. The KNP is a world-renowned tourism destination with approximately 1.6  million visitors annually (SANParks, 2014). Despite the conservation successes of KNP, the early establishment of the  Park involved forced removals of people from within the KNP boundaries, supported by policies that restricted access  to certain sectors of society (Carruthers, 1995). This was at a time when the South African apartheid government was  moving thousands of people into culturally homogenous ‘‘Bantustan” homeland areas, some of which bordered the  KNP. Currently, approximately 2 million people reside in the 7 South African municipalities bordering KNP, many of  whom rely on subsistence agriculture and social grants due to high regional unemployment rates (municipal level  unemployment rates range from 28.1% to 52.1%) (Stats SA, 2015). The area is typified by low agricultural potential  (Lahiff and Cousins, 2009) and employment within KNP is very sought after. The 1073 km of KNP periphery abuts  private and government conservation land, rural and urban towns and villages, agriculture and industry – the diversity  of which would be hard to meet anywhere else in the world. "
17,"The iSimangaliso Wetland Park is located in KwaZulu-Natal, one of the three poorest provinces in South Africa. It falls  within the uMkhanyakude District Municipality, ranked as one of the poorest and most deprived municipality in the  country. According to the 2011 national census, the surrounding districts have a population of 676,810. Over 80% of  households live below the poverty line and an estimated 13% of the economically active population is formally  employed. Of the population’s citizens who are 20 years and older, 25.4% have grade 12 and 4.9% have higher  education. The unemployment rate is 42.8% and HIV prevalence is between 13 and 15%. Gender-based violence  (GBV) is equally widespreadHigh dependency ratios, HIV/AIDS prevalence, numbers of orphaned children,  unemployment and social grant dependency make for highly vulnerable communities. The social impacts of migration  remain strong – many households are female-headed or headed by orphaned children. In this context, many  households rely extensively on natural resources from iSimangaliso for survival, for example, harvesting of reeds and  fruit, agriculture and fishing. The depletion and degradation of natural resources in communal areas has meant that  there is increasing pressure on the resources inside the Park.  This trade-off between short and long-term livelihood  strategies stems from the conditions of poverty that characterize the lives of 80% of the people living in the area. The  need to deliver tangible benefits to local communities is, thus, not only an economic imperative but also conservation  imperative. "
18,"D. 2. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established comprising of staff from SANParks, iSimangaliso Wetland  Authority, and The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) tasked with the responsibility for financial  management, procurement and environmental and social management, monitoring and supervision. The PIU will be  domiciled in DEFF for the sole purpose of coordinating the project implementation and overseen by a multi- stakeholder project steering committee, with participation of the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries  (former DEA), local governments, project partners, civil society, and private sector representatives.This PIU has "

21,"appointed a gender and social inclusion specialist and a stakeholder engagement specialist as part of the safeguard  team. The environmental specialist identification is being finalized. This team will lead the preparation and  implementation of the ESA instruments. They will be in turn supported by the PIUs at SANPark, SANBI and  Isimangaliso for the actual investment implementation. "
22,"South African National Parks (SANParks) - a public entity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Environmental  Affairs - is the leading conservation authority in all national parks in South Africa. It manages a system of 19 national  parks in seven of the nine provinces of South Africa with a total area of just over 4 million hectares comprising 67% of  the protected areas under state management. The SANParks is recognised as a world leader in conservation and  protected area management. Conservation, responsible tourism and socio-economic development are the three core  pillars of its operations. In relation to the last pillar, SANParks has expanded its role in the developmental support  provided to neighbouring communities as an entity of the developmental state. SANParks is implementing a number  of social programmes promoting access and benefit sharing, socio-economic development and improved living  conditions for local communities living around the national parks. The institution has shown significant capacity in  managing the environmental and social impacts of its activities to meet requirements of national law and good  practice. However, SANParks has never implemented a WB project and requires training in the application of the new  Environmental and Social Framework (ESF)."
23,"The iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority has strong capacity for addressing environmental and social risks and  impacts of projects consistent with the South Africa National Environmental Management Act. This includes  implementation capacity, a proven track record for high quality environment work at both the strategic and project- specific level, and enforcement at the Park level. The national environmental regulatory framework applicable to the  iSimangaliso Wetland Park is sound, well designed and adequately enforced. The iSimangaliso Authority is subject to  institutional oversight and monitoring by the South Africa’s Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries.  However, with the launching of the new Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) on 1 October 2018, the  iSimangaliso Authority will need to be trained on the new ESF to meet the requirements under each Environmental  and Social Standard. "
24,"SANBI is a public institution established in September 2004 in terms of the National Environmental Management:  Biodiversity Act (Act No 10 of 2004). The mandate of SANBI is to play a leading role in South Africa’s national  commitment to biodiversity management, and it is tasked to lead the country’s biodiversity research agenda, in  partnership with the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries. SANBI also contributes to the key  government priority of eradicating poverty through by creating sustainable employment opportunities."
25,An Institutional Capacity Assessment will be undertaken as part of the ESMF and a Strengthening Plan  will be  developed to strengthen any identified capacity gaps. 
26,II. SCREENING OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL (ES) RISKS AND IMPACTS

29,"The Environmental Risk Classification of the Project is Moderate under the World Bank’s ESF. The proposed project is  expected to generate significant environmental benefits resulting from the Project’s focus on restoration and  conservation of terrestrial and aquatic ecological processes and management of both the iSimangaliso Wetland Park  and the Kruger National Park as well as support for a number of local development initiatives in creating employment  and generating livelihoods for local communities living within the protected areas. No significant or irreversible  environmental risks and impacts are anticipated. Some temporary, localized, adverse environmental impacts of minor  to moderate scale are anticipated partly during the construction phase including dust, noise, management and  disposal of debris and other construction related waste. However, these environmental risks and impacts will be site  specific, temporary, and irreversible by applying good construction practices to be included in the ESMF,  covering  environmental screening, chance find procedures, OHS, and developing site-specific ESMPs for individual contractors  to manage the civil works. "
30,"The Social Risk Rating is considered to be moderate at this stage as the Project does not involve activities with a  potential to harm the population taking into account the nature and magnitude of the potential social risks and  impacts of the proposed activities. The potential adverse impacts on local communities will be limited, site-specific  and few and can be managed with the application of appropriate mitigation measures. Key social concerns are related  to (1) labor and working conditions of those engaged in the sub-project minor construction works and those directly  engaged by the project to provide technical services; (2) community health and safety related to the minor  construction works; and (3)  potential land access restrictions; and (4) the need to consider the potential escalation of  conflicts among stakeholders due to the participatory planning activities as well as the potential risk of GBV in  particular Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA). The activities to be financed by the project will include participatory  planning and collaborative multi-stakeholder platforms, capacity building and skills development and the promotion  of inclusive value chains and businesses. The project needs to pay attention to the participatory planning activities  that could lead to conflicts among stakeholders and potentially risks of gender based violence. To address this  potential risk, the project will support the preparation of a shared “integrated landscape management vision” based  on existing planning instruments and on discussions with local stakeholders, including local government, private  sector, local communities, civil society organizations. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan applying a conflict management  approach along with a Grievance Mechanism  will also be prepared to help in preventing and solving potential  community conflicts.  A GBV assessment tool and other relevant assessment tools will be used to identify potential  GBV risks and mitigation measures to address the identified risks, such measures will be included in the detailed  ESMPs. The proposed project is expected to have a positive socio-economic impact because it seeks to improve the  skills of the local communities and increase the number of conservation-compatible businesses and associated  income and jobs to local communities. Due to its participatory approach, the project is not expected to bring any  adverse effects for beneficiary communities. Instead, it will support only activities that will contribute to improve the  livelihood of local communities, increase their social resilience, adaptive and mitigating capacity to deal with the  social and environmental pressures that they face as well as strengthen the capacity of their representative  institutions to plan and to promote the effective, efficient and sustainable management of their lands and natural  resources."

35,"The first two components of the project - promoting integrated landscape management and strengthening the  enabling environment for promoting conservation-compatible rural development around targeted protected areas  landscapes - will support studies, document review, training, coaching, mentoring, South-South exchanges, capacity  building, technical assistance (TA) and sensitization campaigns, which are not anticipated to result in direct or indirect  environmental and social risks and impacts. Therefore, as a result of the screening no further environmental and  social assessment (ESA) is proposed for Components 1 and 2. However, relevant requirements of the ESF will be  incorporated in the TOR for the TA activity to ensure that any potential E&S risks related to implementation of the TA  or TA outputs is consistent with ESF requirements. "
36,"ESA requirements of ESS1 are considered relevant for subprojects under Component 3, which will be implemented  through a matching grant scheme. General types of possible impacts relate to labor conditions, occupational health  and safety, community health and safety, gender-based violence in particular sexual exploitation and abuse,  exclusion of disadvantaged groups and pollution prevention. Potential impacts of attracting more people to sensitive  areas through support for economic activities will equally be assessed as part of the ESMF and proportionate  mitigation measures will be identified. Because the specific subprojects have not yet been identified, the Client will  prepare an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to set out the principles, rules, guidelines and  procedures to assess the environmental and social risks and impacts and guide the screening for environmental and  social risks and impacts of sub-projects under the matching grant component, including identifying the appropriate  ESA instruments, mitigation and monitoring measures to manage the environmental and social risks and impacts,  including roles and responsibilities, schedule, costs and implementation procedures. The draft ESMF will be disclosed  in-country and on the Bank's external website prior to appraisal. Value chain and businesses subprojects will be  subject to screening against eligibility criteria, including environmental and social risk screening. A list of non-eligible  value chains and businesses will be developed to include subprojects which might likely generate high and/or  substantial environmental and social risks and impacts. The ESMF will also include   a generic Environmental and  Social Management Plan (ESMP) with guidelines for general mitigation and monitoring measures for value chains and  businesses, sub projects that will be identified during project implementations, roles and responsibilities, time plans,  costs and implementation agencies for each mitigation measure recommended. This generic ESMP will then be  adaptable for specific value chains and businesses as they become identified during project implementation.  Entrepreneurs accessing the Matching Grant Scheme (MGS) will be required, as a condition of their contracts with  the project, to implement and comply with the ESMP."
37,Areas where “Use of Borrower Framework” is being considered: The Borrower’s E&S framework will not be applied.
38,"The Implementing Agency will conduct stakeholder mapping, analysis and prepare a Stakeholder Engagement Plan  (SEP). A draft of the SEP will be prepared and disclosed as early as possible and prior to Appraisal. The Borrower will  seek stakeholder feedback and opportunities for proposed future engagement, ensuring that all consultations are  inclusive and accessible (both in format and location) and through channels that are suitable in the local context.

41,"Borrower will provide stakeholders with timely, relevant, understandable and accessible information, and consult  with them in a culturally appropriate manner, which is free of manipulation, interference, coercion, discrimination  and intimidation. If major changes are made to the SEP, a revised SEP should be publicly disclosed. The Borrower will  engage in meaningful consultations with all stakeholders throughout the project-life cycle, paying attention to the  inclusion of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups (including the elderly, persons with disabilities, female headed  households and orphans and vulnerable children). Directly-affected stakeholders are likely to include (i) community  members, in particular individual entrepreneurs, small, medium and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs), community- based organizations (CBOs), such as co-operatives, who will receive training and/or grants under the project; (ii)  private sector firms that may establish partnerships with entrepreneurs in local communities; and (iii) service  providers and NGOs providing technical assistance and training; (iv) Community-level governance structures (CPAs or  community trusts) that will benefit through strengthening of capacity for negotiation of land tenure security and co- management of natural resources. Other interested parties are likely to include the Department of Environmental  Affairs, provincial and municipal authorities, communities living in the selected landscapes, and the general public. A  comprehensive grievance and redress mechanism (GRM) will be designed, developed and maintained by the  implementing agencies. The GRM will enable stakeholders to channel concerns, questions, and complaints from  communities and other stakeholders and respond to issues related to a broad range of project implementation  issues."
42,The Implementing Agency will consult upon and disclose the ESMF in line with the requirements of the ESF. The ESMF  will be disclosed in-country and the Bank’s external website prior to appraisal.
43,A brief description of the potential environmental and social risks and impacts relevant to the Project.
44,"ESS2 is relevant to both the staff contracted to provide services directly under the project (training, planning,  technical assistance etc.) and to businesses and value chain subprojects to be supported with the Matching Grant  Scheme. Matching Grant eligibility requirements will include the preparation of Labor Management Procedures  including key aspects of labor rights and occupational health and safety, and verification that all subproject workers  have been made aware of the provisions of these procedures. The occupational health and safety (OHS) measures  will be in line with World Bank Group General Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. Minor construction  activities are envisaged for the project, but these will be temporary, localized and with limited foot print and  therefore does not entail a significant amount of labor. Any labor required for the implementation of the value chain  projects will be locally hired, with the exception of skilled workers who cannot be found in the protected areas  landscapes. No labor camps are anticipated for any of the value chain projects and no influx of workforce is  anticipated based on the proposed project structure. "
45,"This standard is relevant given that the project will finance development of sustainable businesses and value chains  including agricultural related activities such as post-harvest management, processing and commercialization of "

48,agricultural products and make use of agrochemicals. The ESMF will include specific measures to minimize/avoid the  potential negative impacts related to the use of agrochemicals including pesticides. 
49,"The project is not expected to cause any adverse safety and health impacts on the communities since the project is  not funding any large-scale civil works on the ground.  A preliminary GBV risk screening has been undertaken and the  risk has been classified as Low. The value chain subprojects will not be large-scale and therefore it is not expected  that there will be an influx of workers into the subprojects areas. However, in the event that influx would occur the  ESMF and subsequent ESMPs will include mitigation measures for labor influx management. In addition, there may be  minor community health and safety related impacts during the subprojects preparation, mitigation measures for such  potential impacts will be captured in the  corresponding ESMP. Furthermore, potential risks of GBV/SEA will be  considered in the ESMF and subsequent ESMPs and measures will be put in place to mitigate and manage any risks of  GBV/SEA incidents."
50,"ESS5 Land Acquisition, Restrictions on Land Use and Involuntary Resettlement Involuntary resettlement is not expected to occur through the project activities as the project will support the  expansion of protected areas into community and private-owned areas following the Biodiversity Stewardship model,  which was recently developed and implemented in South Africa. However, it is likely that restrictions on land use may  occur and as such a Process Framework has been recommended. Based on available information, it is not expected  that these restrictions would potentially affect informal users, tenants and workers,  nor displacing informal or illegal  activities to other nearby areas, however, this will be further assessed during the Bank's due diligence mission as well  as in the ESMF. Potential impacts of attracting more people to sensitive areas through support for economic activities  will equally be assessed as part of the ESMF and proportionate mitigation measures will be identified. "
51,"Biodiversity Stewardship is an approach to entering into agreements with private and communal landowners to  protect and manage land in biodiversity priority areas, led by conservation authorities. Since Biodiversity Stewardship  is based on voluntary commitments from landowners with a range of different types of biodiversity stewardship  agreements regulated by the Protected Areas Act, it is unlikely that adverse impacts on private land, assets or  involuntary resettlement will occur. The same applies to the businesses and value chain subprojects that will be  supported by the Matching Grant Scheme that do not envisage major civil works. In the event that these subprojects  would require the relocation of community members, this will be on a voluntary basis as per the Biodiversity  Stewardship model and will require an assessment of potential adverse impacts. In the event that new information is  available during appraisal indicating that there may be involuntary relocation or impacts on livelihoods, the necessary  ESA instruments will be required. "
52,"The project is designed to generate positive environment benefits by promoting conservation-compatible  development in local communities within the KNP and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and, in turn, strengthen long- term support for conservation of the PAs.  Therefore, adverse impacts to biodiversity are anticipated to be limited.  The ESMF will confirm the presence of threatened/endangered species according to the IUCN Classification and of "

55,"the sensitivity of the project site for bird species including migratory birds. The KNP hosts populations of several  species of IUCN Red List vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered mammals, including lion (Panthera leo  melanochaita), leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus), elephant (Loxodonta africana),  hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), wild dog (Lycaon pictus), and  black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis minor). Due diligence carried out on the iSimangaliso Wetland Park indicate the  following potential threats to natural habitats from the documentation of the World Heritage Convention and the  current approach used by the Wetland Authority to address the threats – (i) the plantation of alien invasive species  the reduced water for indigenous plant and animal species and caused the soil to become more alkaline, which  further promoted encroachment in sensitive ecosystems, and (ii) uncontrolled harvesting of Ncema, a salt marsh  rush, used in the construction of huts. However, as part of its broader Community Based Natural Resource  Management program, the Wetlands Authority has regulated the annual harvest and cutting practices, to balance  communities' current needs with the longer-term sustainability of the ncema resource. At this stage of the project,  no new information is showing displacement of economic activities to sensitive areas, and therefore, no adverse risks  and impacts are anticipated. Should there be changes during project preparation, the Appraisal ESRS will include the  necessary changes, their associated environmental risks and impacts and the corresponding mitigation measures.  Potential impacts of attracting more people to sensitive areas through support for economic activities will equally be  assessed as part of the ESMF and proportionate mitigation measures will be identified."
56,"BBased on information currently available, this standard does not appear to be relevant to the project. However, this  will be further verified during the preparation mission and as part of the social impact assessment included in the  ESMF and SEP. "
57,"Based on information currently available, ESS8 does not appear to be relevant to the project, as the project is not  likely to have risks or impacts on cultural heritage. However, should there be any construction contracts identified,  Chance Find Procedures will apply and these will be included as part of the ESMF, which will require contractors to  stop construction in the event that cultural property sites are encountered during construction. Possible impacts on  Cultural Heritage will be further assessed and the applicability of the ESS will be determined during the  environmental and social assessment described in ESS1."
