109,"1. China’s rapid growth has led to severe pressures on its environment and natural resources, with impacts on the  economy, human health, and global climate. Over the past four decades, China has experienced an extraordinary period  of economic growth averaging over 10 percent per year, with a 25-fold increase in per capita income.1 The Government  announced on February 25, 2021, that it had reached its goal of eliminating rural extreme poverty.2 However, such rapid  growth has resulted in challenges of pollution and inefficiencies in resource use. The implied economic cost of  environmental degradation was estimated as 2.2 to 3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) annually between 2004  and 2017,3 evident in widespread air, soil, and water pollution and diminishing biodiversity levels.4 Impacts from climate  change have compounded these environmental issues and contributed further to economic costs.5 These damages are  increasingly reflected in community concerns, with the number of related petition letters and visits received by the central  government increasing 16-fold between 1996 and 2018.6 In 2020, the Yale Environmental Performance Index ranked China  120 out of 180 countries based on multiple environmental dimensions. While this is an improvement over previous years,  multiple environmental indicators remain below those of other income-comparable, upper-middle-income countries.7 "
110,"2. Recognizing these challenges, transitioning to a more balanced and sustainable economic growth model has  become a key policy priority. China's 13th Five Year Plan (FYP) (2016–2020) emphasized the need for high-quality green  development based on productivity and innovation, rebalancing of growth toward consumption and services, and  increased stringency of environmental regulations.8 Central government funding of environmental protection and  pollution control increased to US$35.7 billion by 2019, five times more than in 2017.9 China saw a slowdown in the growth  of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduced local air and water pollution,10 improved resource efficiency, and enhanced  land management during this period.11 The 14th FYP (2021–2025), released in March 2021, reflected a strengthening of  ambitions, including planned reductions in GHG emission intensity and improved water pollution and land management,  and references the importance of climate change adaptation. The intended shift toward green development is  encapsulated by the concept of an ‘ecological civilization’—a more harmonious relationship between society and the  environment.12 This concept represents a key political vision and was enshrined in China’s constitution in 2018.13 "
111,"3. Addressing water pollution, including plastic debris, and improving riverine ecological health are integral  elements of this greener vision. Despite some improvements in recent years, challenges of water quality remain acute.14  Around 29 percent of major rivers fail to meet the basic quality standards (grades I–III) required for drinking water supply "
112,"  1 Income per capita rose from US$300 in 1978 to US$10,276 in 2019. Extreme poverty rate fell from 88.1 percent in 1981 to 3.2 percent by the end  of 2018. Poverty is based on the (2011 purchasing power parity) US$1.90 per day poverty line. See World Bank Open Data (link).  2 AP news, February 25, 2021.

114,"and ecosystem function.15 Pollution sources include industrial, domestic, and agricultural activities, with challenges  increasingly around non-point sources (NPSs) such as agriculture. Biodiversity faces continued threats from water  pollution, urbanization, overabstraction, and other human uses of the water environment, with climate change  compounding these threats by shifting habitat ranges and amplifying weather extremes such as drought.16 Studies have  also highlighted the role of China’s rivers in transporting plastic waste to oceans.17 While there is a need for further  research, an estimated 17.2 million tons of China’s plastic waste is mismanaged,18 and between 1.32 and 3.53 million tons  of plastic enter China's oceans, primarily via rivers, every year. In the absence of interventions, this volume is expected to  grow as the consumption of plastics doubles over the next two decades.19 Across types and sources, the cost of water  pollution in China was estimated at US$141 billion nationwide in 2017.20 "
115,"4. The Yangtze River Basin and the economic belt it defines is a necessary focus of the Government's efforts toward  a greener China. The Yangtze River Basin includes 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including the  nine provinces and two municipalities that define the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). 21 The Yangtze River—the  world’s third largest—and its basin play a major role in the historical, cultural, and political identity of China and have  important implications for China's water, food, and energy security. The annual water resources of the basin are estimated  at over 995 billion cubic meters, roughly 35 percent of the national total. Over 200 billion cubic meters of water are drawn  from the basin annually, supporting industry and providing drinking water for almost 600 million people.22 The YREB is an  important manufacturing hub, lying at the heart of global supply chains, and is one of the world’s busiest inland waterways  for freight traffic. In 2018, the GDP generated in the YREB was estimated at US$5.7 trillion (CNY 40.3 trillion), accounting  for 45 percent of national GDP.23 If the YREB were a country, it would be the third-largest economy in the world.24 "
116,"5. The Yangtze River Basin has some of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. The Basin is one of the world’s  most biologically diverse ecoregions due to its climatic and geographic variation, as well as its complex hydrology and  floodplain dynamics.25 The Basin supports over 200 fish species, more than 84 mammal species, 60 amphibian species,  and 87 reptile species. It has a forest coverage rate of over 40 percent and is home to some of China’s most iconic and  endangered species, including the Chinese sturgeon, finless porpoise, Chinese alligator, and the giant panda. It is home to  33 percent of the rare or endangered freshwater fish species in China and accounts for around 40 percent of the country’s  rare or endangered plants. The Basin's lakes provide critical habitat for internationally migratory birds, including 95  percent of the wintering Siberian white crane population. "
117,"6. The Yangtze River and its tributaries face persistent challenges of water pollution and ecological degradation.  Over the past four decades, the Basin has experienced large-scale, high-intensity development and water-polluting  industrial activity, and the Yangtze is today one of the most human-affected large rivers in the world. Development has  severely impeded hydrological flows, sediment transportation, and nutrient distribution. Urban areas have increased "

120,"dramatically, and lake and wetland areas have decreased, with more than 800 lakes within the central basin lost to land  reclamation. Over 40 percent of lakes and reservoirs across the Basin are subject to eutrophication26 with agricultural NPS  pollution, notably runoff from excessive fertilizer application, a major contributor.27 The resulting degradation of water  quality and loss of ecological function is driving losses of globally significant biodiversity, as well as undermining the Basin’s  contribution to human uses.28 "
121,"7. Of water pollutants affecting the Yangtze, total phosphorus is one of the most problematic. China’s chemical  fertilizer use, at 322 kg per ha, is almost three times the global average of 137 kg per ha.29 The Yangtze River is reportedly  among the top major rivers globally most severely affected by phosphorus.30 The largest source of phosphorus in the  Yangtze River Basin is intensive agriculture, including chemical fertilizer use in vegetable and cereal cropping, along with  livestock and poultry operations. Domestic wastewater is another major source. Phosphorus contributes to reduced water  quality in key biodiversity areas, including Poyang and Dongting Lakes, major wetlands systems providing habitat to an  estimated 400,000 species of waterbirds, including the critically endangered Siberian white crane, and other species such  as the finless porpoise. Phosphorus that reaches the oceans contributes to algal blooms and hypoxia in coastal waters.  These challenges are not unique to China, with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and others  highlighting that there is an imbalance in the global phosphorus cycle that threatens ecosystems and food security.31  "
122,"8. The Yangtze River is also reported to be a major source of global marine plastic pollution. A 2015 study32  estimated that China is a significant contributor to ocean plastic debris and that its rivers—most notably the Yangtze—are  the primary conduit, making China’s contribution to combating marine plastic pollution critically important. While there  is a need for more research on precise volumes, uncollected or mishandled rural waste and agricultural plastics are likely  to be major sources,33 with the Yangtze River delivering an estimated 0.31–0.48 million tons of plastic to the ocean every  year. Marine plastic pollution has detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems through entanglement and indigestion by  wildlife and ecotoxicity impacts on micro-organisms.34 Plastics remain in the oceans for hundreds of years, gradually  disintegrating over time, with small particles and polymers entering food chains with potential risks for human health.35  Direct economic damages include reduced fisheries value, losses in the marine and coastal tourism sector, and impacts  on shipping, with an estimated direct cost of at least US$11 billion annually in the Asia Pacific region alone.36  "
123,"9. Many of the challenges facing the Yangtze River Basin are exacerbated by climate change, while the region is  itself a source of GHG emissions. A Climate and Disaster Risk Screening37 plus peer-reviewed literature highlights that the "
124,"  26 The process of eutrophication is driven by changes in the concentration of nutrients (that is, phosphorous and nitrogen), which are indicated by  the levels of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, and transparency. It is a serious environmental problem that leads to reduced oxygen levels in the  water, toxicity from algal blooms, and ecological decline.

126,"basin can expect a hotter future, with more, and more variable, rainfall. A 10–21 percent increase in runoff is forecast for  2041–2070 relative to 1970–2000,38 which is likely to exacerbate flooding and associated economic costs39 and increase  the levels and variations in water pollution (including plastic debris) due to more intense precipitation and floods events  resulting in spikes in runoff. Changes in the hydrological regime are likely to increase pressure on biodiversity and  ecosystems, particularly sensitive wetland and floodplain species, and the fact that past flows are not necessarily a good  predictor of future flows will have implications for longer-term ecological protection. Water pollution also contributes to  GHG emissions, notably due to methane released from the eutrophication process that occurs in nutrient-enriched waters.  The overapplication of synthetic fertilizers also leads directly to GHG emissions from the soil, most notably nitrogen  dioxide.40 "
127,"10. Efforts to improve ecological protection and reduce water pollution in the Yangtze River Basin are critical if the  Government is to achieve its stated water and environment objectives. The Government’s overarching objectives are  articulated by a series of targets and plans for water and the environment. The ‘Most Stringent System for Water Resource  Management’ was established in 2012, setting ‘Three Red Lines’ with specific targets for water withdrawals, water use  efficiency, and water quality. The ‘Water Ten Plan’, issued in 2015, proposed measures to strengthen water pollution  control and improve ecosystem services. These have been complemented by three further ‘redline’ policies promoting  green development: the ‘Ecological Redlines’, the ‘Environmental Quality Baseline’, and the ‘Resource Utilization  Threshold’. These complement wide-ranging sectoral reforms aimed at addressing persistent pollution challenges. For  example, a National Sustainable Agricultural Development Plan (2015–2030) targets zero growth of fertilizer as part of  efforts to combat NPS pollution and reduce GHG emissions. The waste management sector is under transition as part of  efforts toward a circular economy. Sector developments include policies banning certain plastic waste imports in 2017,  plastic pollution control measures (January 2020), and specific provisions in the Solid Waste Law (April 2020) to improve  the management of solid waste and reduce plastics use, including agricultural plastic film.41 Moreover, China’s National  Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2011–2030) targets measures to address environmental pollution  given the significant impacts on aquatic, riverine, and coastal biodiversity and habitats, specifically prioritizing efforts in  Yangtze River to improve conservation of rare and critically endangered species, such as the Siberian white crane, Chinese  sturgeon, and finless porpoise. The geographic and economic significance of the Yangtze River Basin ensures that progress  within the Basin will substantially determine national outcomes. "
128,"11. Significant public and private infrastructure investments have resulted in improved water quality in the Yangtze  River Basin; however, further improvements will require institutional measures. The proportion of major river basins  meeting drinking water standards (class I–III) increased from 61 percent in 2011 to 83 percent in 2020. Despite these  achievements, control of some specific pollutants remains challenging. Total phosphorus levels, for example, remain  above national standards in some water quality monitoring sections.42 The portion of lakes and reservoirs in the Yangtze  River Basin exhibiting ‘moderate’ eutrophication43 increased from 31 percent in 2009 to 42 percent in 2018.44 While  further infrastructure investments are needed for the control and treatment of point and non-point sources of pollution  in specific locations, broader and sustained improvements will require improvements in institutions and management "

132,"12. Recognizing these needs, the Yangtze River Protection Law45 was approved by the National People’s Congress  on December 26, 2020. The law came into effect in March 2021 and is the first legislation for a specific river basin in China.  It was formulated to strengthen the protection and restoration of the ecological environment in the Yangtze River Basin;  it proposes the establishment of a National Yangtze River Basin Coordination Mechanism46 and infers obligations on the  national line agencies and provinces to align with its goals of ecological protection and improved water quality. The law  calls for local governments to establish water quality baselines, prepare total phosphorus pollution control plans, reduce  pollutant discharge through investments in wastewater treatment facilities and piped networks, and control agricultural  NPS pollution, including through the promotion of organic fertilizers and control of agricultural plastic film. The law also  calls on governments to protect and restore ecological function and biodiversity (including through ecological flows) and  improve systems for information sharing and inter-jurisdictional cooperation. The law is an element of the Government's  national strategy for the YREB, which was articulated in the ‘YREB Development Plan’ developed by the National  Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 2016.  "
133,"13. The Yangtze River Protection Law represents the latest in a series of national-level reforms aimed at improving  the management of natural resources and the coordination of water resources development. Earlier reforms include an  amendment to the National Water Law in 2016 to support integrated planning and coordinated basin development.47  Water-related responsibilities were reorganized within the administrative government system in 2018, with water  pollution control responsibilities transferred to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), a new Ministry of Natural  Resources (MNR) established, and responsibilities within the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) consolidated. The  Government established the River Chief System (RCS), a network of officials at the provincial, municipal, county, and  township levels, who are assigned responsibility for outcomes along each section of every major waterway. The system  evolved from efforts to solve water pollution issues in Lake Tai in 200748 and was implemented nationally in 2016. It raises  the priority of water-related issues and has proven useful in addressing challenges of coordination and cooperation  between responsible departments and regions.49 Implementation of the RCS is supported through various mechanisms  including River Chief Offices (RCOs), that usually sit within water agencies at the respective levels.50 China now has over  1.2 million river chiefs with more than 460,000 in the Yangtze River Basin, providing opportunities to address information  asymmetries, promote integrated basin management, and increase public participation in the decision-making process.51 "
134,"  45 The Yangtze River Protection Law of the People's Republic of China (March 2021) (link).  46 The coordination mechanism has the responsibility of “coordinating, guiding and supervising Yangtze River protection work; coordinating and  negotiating the management work between relevant State Council departments and provincial-level governments along the river; organizing and  coordinating joint law enforcement; organizing the establishment and improvement of relevant standards, monitoring, risk early warning,  assessment and evaluation, information sharing and other systems in the Yangtze River basin, and carrying out overall coordination of the  operation of all systems.”  47 Clause 15 of the amended Water Law indicates that “planning for regions within the boundary of a river basin should follow [principles of] river  basin planning, and sector planning should follow [principles of] integrated planning.”  48 Li Y, J Tong, and L Wang. 2020. “Full Implementation of the River Chief System in China: Outcome and Weakness.” Sustainability 12 (9): 3754.  (link)  49 The River and Lake Chief System is intended to strengthen enforcement and accountability regarding water use control, water quality protection,  and restoration of degraded waterways. River chiefs at the village-level are required to patrol no less than once a week while also promoting river  protection and mobilizing the community to assist in the removal of waste. See ""Opinions on Full Implementation of the River Chief System across  the Country"" (2016) (link).  50 The six complementary mechanisms supporting the river chiefs are (a) River Chief Meetings; (b) Information Sharing; (c) Information Reporting;  (d) Supervision; (e) Accountability and Incentives; and (f) Completion and Acceptance.   51 Wu, et al. 2020. “Public Participation of the River Chiefs System in China: Trends, Problems, and Perspectives.” Water 12: 3496 (link).

136,"14. While these institutional reforms provide the foundation for integrated river basin management, the transition  is challenged by overlapping institutional and jurisdictional mandates, among other factors. The YREB Development Plan  and Yangtze River Protection Law are relatively high-level instruments, and their measures require new regulations and  operating procedures at multiple levels of government. More broadly, while the institutional reforms of 2018 signaled an  important shift toward environmentally oriented water policies and clarified responsibilities, they also created challenges  such as the division of responsibilities in basin-level organizations between water quantity management (under the MWR),  water quality management (under MEE), and ecosystem services (under MNR). China’s river basin organizations do not  have the administrative authority or the coordination mechanisms required to align provincial actions, build consensus  with local government, or arbitrate in cases of dispute. Operating efficiency in some water-related infrastructure is low,  and the knowledge base for integrated river basin management (for example, eco-hydrology and related pollution flows)  requires further development. Key water-related data are still segregated across various platforms and agencies, and the  availability of data and consistency over time and between different sources remain a challenge.52 Data sharing within and  between the RCS and the traditional basin management authorities is limited, and data collection protocols are not fully  standardized.53 Addressing these challenges requires an appropriate institutional framework, such as that envisaged by  the National Yangtze River Basin Coordination Mechanism, the continued resolve of political leaders, and mechanisms  that can facilitate inter-jurisdictional cooperation and cross-sectoral coordination. "
137,C. Relationship to the CPS/CPF and Rationale for Use of Instrument 
138,"15. The proposed Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (YRPERP, or the ‘Program’, see  Section II) emphasizes global public goods. This is aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework  (CPF) for China (FY 2020–2025) (Report No. 117875-CN), which was discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive  Directors on December 5, 2019,54 and the new phase of the World Bank Group’s engagement in China. Specifically, the  program focuses on institutions and systems for integrated basin management that can make a significant contribution to  global public goods through pollution reduction and biodiversity protection (Box 1). It thus contributes to Engagement  Area 2 of the CPF, ""promoting greener growth,"" by reducing water and marine plastic pollution and strengthening  sustainable management of natural resources. Moreover, lessons and knowledge generated by the Program are expected  to be relevant for addressing integrated natural resource management issues elsewhere and may be scaled up (including  with non-World Bank Group resources) in other basins in China and internationally. The Program aligns with the World  Bank Group’s Green, Inclusive, and Resilient Development (GRID) framework and the Climate Change Action Plan 2021- 2025.55 "

141,Box 1. Contribution of the Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program to Global Public Goods 
142,"The Program contributes to three primary global public goods: reduce pollution (plastics and phosphorus), support biodiversity,  and reduce GHG emissions.  "
143,"• Marine plastics: The Yangtze River is estimated to be one of the world’s largest single riverine sources of plastics, which affect  marine ecosystems and wildlife via entanglement and indigestion and ecotoxicity.56 The Program builds on an increasing  portfolio of World Bank-financed projects supporting the collection and removal of plastic waste,57 including agricultural plastic  films that commonly ends up in waterways.58 The Program will support the development of implementation plans for plastic  pollution management in demonstration provinces for longer-term institutionalized impact. "
144,"• Greenhouse gases: The Program will lessen eutrophication and thus methane emissions from waterways, a potent GHG  source.59 This will be achieved through the support for measures such as manure management and reuse, increased treatment  plant operating efficiencies, and management plans for key nutrient pollutants, actions that reduce nutrient loads in waterways  and thus eutrophication.  "
145,"• Phosphorous: Phosphorus contributes to reduced water quality in lakes and rivers and contributes to algal blooms and hypoxia  in coastal seas. An imbalance in the global phosphorus cycle is a major threat to ecosystems globally, driving biodiversity loss,  fish kills, and GHG emissions at a global scale and degrading coastal ecosystems.60 These effects will be exacerbated by climate  change. Support for improved phosphorus source identification, measurement, and mitigation under the Program is expected  to benefit ecosystems locally while providing lessons for improved phosphorus management in large watersheds globally. "
146,"• Biodiversity: The Yangtze River Basin is a globally significant biodiversity hotspot.61 Its waterways, floodplains, and wetland  systems provide habitat to a range of endangered species and internationally migratory birds, and the Poyang and Dongting  Lakes—target areas within the Program—are home to five Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance.62 The Program will  support implementation of water and environment management plans that promote habitat protection, as well as ecological  flows that safeguard water for the environment. The Program will also support research on ecological restoration and protection  measures at the basin level. "
147,The actions supported by the Program that contribute to these outcomes are described further in section II. 
148,"16. A Program for Results (PforR) has been identified as the most appropriate instrument to help improve the  targeting and results orientation of public expenditures in support of the YREB. The PforR is designed to support a nested  hierarchy of interlinked institutional improvements at multiple levels—basin, province, sub-basin, and county—that are  required to address the Basin's challenges in a complex and evolving development context (box 2). The PforR instrument  leverages significant resources under existing Government programs, providing for impact beyond traditional Investment  Project Financing (IPF). The PforR focuses on a subset of activities where the Government wants to enhance efficiency,  effectiveness, and impact of expenditure by linking the disbursement of funds to the achievement of specific results. The  reliance on Government systems, and the design of the Program through a nested hierarchy, is aligned with China’s fiscal  governance structure and differentiated responsibilities across governance levels (as specified under the Yangtze River  Protection Law). The PforR instrument is also conceptually aligned with the results-based design of many of China’s land "

Ramsar sites are important biodiversity hotspots. The Dong (East) Dongting Lake wetland,  for example, is an important migration stopover and wintering area for the critically endangered Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), the  endangered Oriental Stork (Ciconia boyciana), and 12 other globally threatened waterbirds. It also serves as a refuge for the critically endangered  Chinese Sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) and the Finless Porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides). "

151,"and water management programs (known as eco-compensation), making it a natural complement in this sector.63 The  PforR financing is complemented by a basin-level IPF to support cross-jurisdictional technical assistance (TA) activities at  the basin scale. "
152,Box 2. Evolution of World Bank Support in the Yangtze River Basin 
153,"The World Bank has a long history of supporting China’s efforts  toward sustainable development. Since 1981, the World Bank has  financed more than 170 projects with over US$26 billion in  commitments in China. The majority of these have been in transport  (31 percent of financing), water (24 percent) and energy (16 percent)  (Figure 1). Water's proportion is above the World Bank's global  average (which is around 15 percent), placing China among the  largest of the Bank's borrowers in the water sector. Projects have  been increasingly concentrated in the provinces of the Yangtze River  Basin, accounting for 64 percent of projects (81) and 57 percent  (US$10.15 billion) of financing between 2009 and 2018 (Figure 2).  "
154,"The design of these projects has evolved to respond to the  changing development context. Early support in the water  sector focused on infrastructure and rural development.  The Yangtze River Basin Water Resources Project  (P003596), for example, approved in 1995, supported multi- purpose dam construction, flood management measures,  and the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation  schemes with capacity building. The subsequent CN- Yangtze Dike Strengthening (P064730) Project in 1998 and  the Changjiang/Pearl River Watershed Rehabilitation  Project (P081255) in 2006, focused on essential  infrastructure and sustainable rural development.  "
155,"In more recent years, project focus has evolved toward more complex issues around integrated water resource management,  ecological protection, and natural resources institutions. The YRPERP will build on China's now considerable capacity for  infrastructure development by focusing on contemporary challenges of inter-jurisdictional cooperation and cross-sectoral  coordination. It supports a nested hierarchy of activities that link financing with performance-based targets at the basin, provincial,  and local levels, to address challenges of ecological protection and water pollution. World Bank support aims to unblock institutional  processes that are limited not by technical capacity but by constraints and incentives that undermine collaboration and data sharing  across and between levels of government. The Program aims to have long-term institutional impact by linking financing to  performance-based targets, strengthened monitoring and evaluation (M&E), analytical and policy development, and demonstration  effects that amplify the impacts achieved within the Program's demonstration counties into longer-term provincial and basin-wide  outcomes. "
156,"  63 Eco-compensation programs aim to financially incentivize improved land and water management by sub-national governments, firms, or  households. See World Bank. 2021.

160,"17. The PforR will support a subset of activities from the sub-national provincial programs for the YREB in Jiangxi  and Hunan Provinces. These form part of a national program for the YREB which is articulated through the YREB  Development Plan. The YREB Development Plan aims to prioritize ecological protection, river basin coordination, and  integrated development across the YREB. Implementation of the YREB Development Plan is guided by the ‘Action Plan for  Yangtze River Protection and Restoration’ (the Action Plan).64 In addition, provincial-level subsidiary plans outline local  actions and the expected results that contribute to the YREB Development Plan and Action Plan. These national-level and  provincial-level plans are an integrated package that collectively define the Government program. The national-level plans  provide the overarching vision and broadly defined actions, with the provincial subsidiary plans outlining more specific  actions tailored to each province’s circumstances. The Yangtze River Protection Law (see para. 12) provides important  elements of the legal framework for the Government’s program. The Program assists the selected provinces to meet some  of the requirements under the Law and implement their provincial-level plans. Two provinces, Jiangxi and Hunan, have  been selected for support under the World Bank-financed Program (discussed further in Section C below). "
161,"18. The Government’s program at the provincial level in Jiangxi is outlined in the ‘5-Rivers-1-Lake’ Plan.65 Issued in  March 2019, the 5-Rivers-1-Lake Plan covers the Poyang Lake Basin, defined by the lake and its five major tributaries,66  which spans 94 percent of the province. The plan aims to “promote coordinated socio-economic development and  sustainable resource management, safeguard the health of rivers and lakes, and ensure environmental protection while  supporting a rich, beautiful, happy and modern Jiangxi.” It outlines the basic principles, guidelines, and implementation  arrangements for management and protection of Poyang Lake Basin, along with specific activities and targets within seven  priority areas: (a) coordination for integrated management; (b) spatial management and shoreline protection; (c) water  resources protection; (d) water pollution control including solid waste management; (e) water environment improvement;  (f) rehabilitation of river and lake ecosystems; and, (g) enhancement of river-and-lake management capacity.  Implementation is supported by the Jiangxi River Basin Eco-Compensation Mechanism, which pools67 a range of financing  sources including earmarked funds from national, provincial, municipal, and county governments, as well as private sector  contributions. "
162,"19. The Government’s program at the provincial level in Hunan is outlined in the ‘Integrated Water and  Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin’.68 Issued by NDRC in December 2018, the plan covers Dongting  Lake Basin, defined by the lake and its four major tributaries.69 The basin area spans 97 percent of Hunan, along with small  parts of Hubei Province. The objective of the plan is to ensure the safety of water supply and to significantly improve water  and environmental quality. It outlines the basic principles, guidelines, and implementation arrangements for governance "
163,"  64 Eight priorities are outlined in the Action Plan: (a) establishing an ecological and environmental control system and strictly implementing the  ecological redlines; (b) investigating and managing sewerage outlets and promoting integrated land-water monitoring and management systems;  (c) strengthening the control of industrial pollution and reducing environmental risks; (d) improving environment conditions in rural areas including  control of agricultural non-point source pollution; (e) addressing gaps in environment-related infrastructure, and ensuring the security of drinking  water sources; (f) strengthening pollution control from inland waterways transport, and preventing environmental risks at harbors and ports; (g)  optimizing the allocation of water resources and ensuring ecological flow requirements; and (h) enhancing ecosystem protection. See MEE and  NDRC. 2019. Action Plan for the Uphill Battle for the Conservation and Restoration of the Yangtze River (link).  65 ‘5-Rivers-1-Lake’ refers to the Gan, Fu, Xin, Rao, and Xiu Rivers that flow into Poyang Lake.  66 The Gan, Fu, Xin, Rao, and Xiu Rivers are the major tributaries of Poyang Lake.   67 The Jiangxi River Basin Eco-Compensation Mechanism is not a single provincial budget line and instead comprises a related set of budget lines  (coherently monitored and implemented) that form a program. See Technical Assessment (Annex IV).  68 NDRC. 2018. Integrated Water and Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin (link).  69 The Yuan, Xiang, Zi, and Li Rivers are the major tributaries of Dongting Lake.  "

165,"and protection and describes specific activities, expected results, and indicative targets. To support the Dongting Lake  Basin Plan, the implementation plan70 includes specific targets, including that by 2025: (a) 95 percent of rivers and  waterbodies will reach water quality of Grade III, and the level of total phosphorous will be reduced by 10 percent relative  to 2018; (b) the utilization rate of animal manure will remain at least 75 percent, and fertilizer consumption will remain at  zero growth relative to 2020; (c) the coverage rate of rural wastewater treatment facilities will reach 90 percent, and the  coverage rate of rural solid waste collection and treatment will reach 100 percent; and, (d) the area of wetland restoration  will reach 1 million mu (66,000 ha). As in the Jiangxi program, the Hunan program pools a range of financing sources  including earmarked funds from national, provincial, municipal, and county governments, as well as private sector  contributions. "
166,"20. The Program contributes to a long-term vision of an economically productive, ecologically sustainable, and  climate resilient Yangtze River Basin (Figure 3). The core challenges that the Program addresses include insufficient  coordination of ecological and water management actions across jurisdictions and sectors; a need for provincial-level  guidelines, regulations, and policies to operationalize the new Yangtze River Law; inefficient wastewater treatment;  deficiencies in the management of NPS pollution, including farm manure and agricultural plastic films; and a need for  greater technical understanding (and data sharing) on key issues of pollution and ecological management, particularly  under expected climate shifts within the Basin (see para. 9). The Program will support interventions that address these  challenges on four levels: (a) basin-level coordination, technical guidance, and capacity building; (b) provincial-level  development of policies, regulations, and guidelines; (c) sub-basin-level ecological protection and integrated water  management; and, (d) county-level activities to reduce plastics and nutrient pollution. The expected results are captured  in the three outcomes linked to the Program Development Objective (PDO)—on institutional strengthening, ecological  management, and water pollution reduction—and reflect the Program’s contribution to the Government’s program. A  detailed description of the Program’s structure, activities, and outcome indicators is presented in section II.C. "
167,"21. Key assumptions required for the Program’s success are that: (a) cross-sectoral coordination and inter- jurisdictional cooperation at the national, provincial, and local levels will work effectively both for implementation of  Program activities (for example, information and data sharing) and M&E of Program results; (b) the Basin RCS platform is  established on schedule to facilitate connection of the provincial platforms; (c) provincial policies developed and approved  under the Program are enforced and not contradicted by county- or municipality-level actions; (d) there are no major  droughts or external events that undermine the ability to meet the minimum flow requirements; (e) improved treatment,  management, and reuse of on-farm manure leads to reduced nutrient runoff; (f) there are no major external changes to  pollutant loads that overwhelm the Program’s contribution to key pollution reduction targets; and, (g) improved RCS  information platforms inform river chief actions.

171,"22. The PforR will support a subset of activities from the sub-national provincial programs for the YREB in Jiangxi  and Hunan Provinces that form part of the national program for the YREB. Activities supported by PforR financing  contribute to ecological protection and water pollution reduction goals contained in the provincial plans (see paras. 18  and 19) that themselves contribute to the overarching YREB Development Plan (see para. 17) (Figure 4). The timeline for  the PforR is 2022 to 2026, with 2021 being the baseline year against which outcomes are measured.  "
172,"23. The Program has a layered geographic scope reflecting the tiered governance structure of the YREB national  program. The YREB covers nine provinces and two municipalities71 from the 19 provinces and autonomous regions that  fall within the Yangtze River Basin. The results areas, indicators, outputs, and outcomes are consistent across the two  target provinces, Hunan and Jiangxi. The geographic scope of the Program differs by activity—with basin-, province-, sub- basin-, and county-level activities reflecting the differentiated responsibilities of government and nature of the activity. "
173,"• The Program’s geographic focus within Jiangxi Province is the Poyang Lake Basin. The lake basin covers 94  percent of the province and 90 out of 100 of the province’s counties. Within this area, the PforR will focus  select activities within three results areas. Results Area 1 supports activities at the provincial level aimed at  institutional improvements. Results Area 2 supports ecological protection and climate resilience in the Gan  River sub-basin, which has a length of 766 km and a catchment area of 83,500 km2 covering 51 percent of "

176,"the province, making it the largest river in Jiangxi Province and the fourth largest tributary of the Yangtze  River in terms of annual runoff. The sub-basin includes 44 counties in Jiangxi Province, including more than  10 counties that were designated national-level poverty counties before 2021. Results Area 3 supports  activities to reduced water pollution and transmission of plastic waste in the demonstration counties of Dayu  county, Chongyi county, and Yudu county of Ganzhou municipality; Yongfeng county of Ji’an municipality;  Yugan county of Shangrao municipality; and Fuliang county of Jingdezhen municipality. "
177,"• The Program’s geographic focus within Hunan Province is the Dongting Lake Basin. The lake basin covers  97 percent of the province, 100 of the province’s counties along with parts of Guangxi, Guizhou, Chongqing,  and Hubei. The total catchment area is 262,000 km2, accounting for 14 percent of the Yangtze River Basin,  and includes four major tributaries. Within this area, the PforR will focus select activities within three results  areas. Results Area 1 supports activities at the provincial level aimed at institutional improvements. Results  Area 2 supports ecological protection and climate resilience in the Yuan River sub-basin, the second largest  river in Hunan Province with a length of 1,033 km and a catchment area of 89,163 km2 covering 24 percent  of the province. Results Area 3 supports activities to reduced water pollution and transmission of plastic  waste in the demonstration districts and counties of Miluo county-level city of Yueyang municipality, Ziyang  district of Yiyang municipality, Shimen county of Changde municipality, and Yuanling county of Huaihua  municipality. "
178,"24. The Program’s geographic focus thus targets two of the most important middle-reach provinces of the Yangtze.  Hunan and Jiangxi face important pollution challenges, including NPS from extensive agricultural development, and are  home to critical natural resource assets including the unique ecologies of Poyang and Dongting lakes and their associated  tributaries (which are major tributaries for the basin), as well as sub-national provincial YREB programs ready for support  and scaling. Within these provinces, demonstration counties were selected based on several factors, including: (a) an RCS  in place and either an existing management information platform or willingness to connect to the provincial river chief  platform; (b) a long-term water environment protection plan or an equivalent plan under preparation; (c) plans to take  innovative measures to ensure sustainability of program investments; and (d) location within the demonstration sub- basins.

181,"25. In addition to the PforR financing of provincial-level activities, the Program includes a Central Basin IPF to  support basin-level activities aligned with the national program for the YREB (with the central government as the  borrower for the IPF). The Program’s Central Basin IPF is proposed to be financed by an IBRD loan in the amount of  US$7.5 million. The supported activities will promote cross-sectoral coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation  toward improving water quality, ecological protection, and climate resilience in the Yangtze River Basin, through enhanced  coordination mechanisms, research and policy options for water pollution reduction, ecological guidelines and standards,  improved data compilation and management, and capacity building. NDRC, through the Program Steering Committee, will  provide strategic guidance for the implementation of the Central Basin IPF, with a Central Project Management Office  (CPMO) hosted by the Changjiang Water Resources Commission (CWRC), the basin management authority for the Yangtze  River under the MWR, being responsible for day-to-day implementation. Activities under the Central Basin IPF are detailed  in annex 7 and summarized below: "
182,"(a) Operationalization of the basin-level RCS collaboration mechanism. This comprises operationalization of a  basin-level RCS collaboration mechanism, a forum for decision-making, coordination, learning, and inter- jurisdictional strategy development. The design for such a mechanism was completed by the CWRC with  World Bank support in 2021.72 This mechanism will be complemented by a basin RCS platform to promote  inter-jurisdictional sharing of river management and climate-related information.73 This includes technical  protocols and capacity building for data collection and use of the platform, which will also be connected with  provincial platforms supported under the PforR.  "

This comprises research  inputs for policies and guidelines for freshwater ecosystem restoration and protection. Research will support  river health guidelines to inform evaluation of riverine ecology, guidelines for determining appropriate  ecological flows, and mechanisms for protection and restoration of the aquatic ecosystems of Poyang Lake,  Dongting Lake, and important tributaries (namely the Jialing, Wujiang and Chishui Rivers). Poyang and  Dongting Lakes are China’s largest freshwater lakes and important biodiversity hotspots, providing habitat  for an array of international migratory bird species and local endangered species,74 while also facing  continued water pollution, ecological damage, and climate-related threats from runoff extremes, flooding,  and extended periods of reduced flow.

201,"26. The Program’s results areas support a nested hierarchy of activities, at provincial, sub-basin, and county levels.  PforR results areas are aligned with the basin-level activities under the Central Basin IPF. The PforR results areas are the  following: "
202,• Results Area 1: Improving Institutions and Innovations (provincial level). This results area will support  institutional improvements for inter-jurisdictional cooperation and cross-sectoral coordination in Hunan and  Jiangxi. Activities under Results Area 1 include 
203,"(a) Strengthening of RCS coordination through the integration of county and municipal, provincial, and  basin-level RCS information platforms;  "
204,"(b) Development of provincial-level policies, regulations and guidelines on integrated water environment,  ecological protection, and plastic waste management; and "
205,"(c) Public engagement in water management, through pollution awareness campaigns, participatory  management and river cleanup activities, and development and dissemination of public engagement  manuals for the RCS. "
206,"Activities supported by Results Area 1 will be implemented by the Provincial Development and Reform  Commission (PDRC) as the coordinating counterpart, with the Provincial Department of Finance (PDF),  Department of Water Resources (DWR), Department of Ecology and Environment (DEE), and Department of  Agricultural and Rural Affairs (DARA) in each province. The supported activities are expected to provide  institutional coordination and the policy foundation for environmental and water management outcomes  and increased ecological resilience via healthier river and lake ecosystems, across the two provinces.  Activities will further contribute to climate adaptation and mitigation through increased public awareness  and extensive climate-related data integration and sharing.77  "
207,• Results Area 2: Advancing Ecological Protection through Integrated River Basin Management (sub-basin  level). This results area will support ecological protection and climate resilience of river and lake ecosystems  in the demonstration sub-basins of Gan River Basin (Jiangxi) and Yuan River Basin (Hunan). Activities under  Results Area 2 include  
208,"(a) Strengthening of integrated water environment management systems, including water environment  management plans; "
209,(b) Development of river health assessment and ecological flow guidelines based on national standards; 
210,(c) Implementation of water allocation schemes based on national standards; and

212,"Activities supported by Results Area 2 will be implemented by the PDRC as the coordinating counterpart,  with the DWR and DEE. Activities will contribute to improved ecological protection by safeguarding water  for the environment as well as through policy, planning, and data measures that strengthen the long-term  basis for protection of aquatic ecosystems. Activities will further contribute to climate adaptation and "
213,"  77 Two specific contributions to climate adaptation are envisaged under Results Area 1: (1) The public engagement manuals to be developed under  the River Chief System will include a specific chapter on climate considerations, providing guidance on: (a) raising people’s awareness on climate  change impacts and risks, (b) promoting climate-sensitive behaviors, such as reducing pollution to avoid algae blooms; and (c) raising preparedness  for climate change-induced drought and flood. (2) The river chief data platforms that will be connected under results area 1 contain extensive  climate-relevant data (see footnote 73); integrating these data will assist water resource managers in understanding trends, responding with  climate-sensitive management actions, and devising climate-sensitive strategies and plans.

216,"• Results Area 3: Reducing Water Pollution and Transmission of Plastic Waste (county level). This results  area will support reduction of point- and non-point-source pollution in demonstration counties. This will  contribute to the reduction of water pollution loads, including plastics, by improving the operation of  township wastewater systems, improving the management and utilization of livestock/poultry manure, and  collecting and recycling agricultural plastic waste, in line with provincial policies in the demonstration  counties. Activities under Results Area 3 include: "
217,(a) Improved integrated wastewater management services and collection systems at township level; 
218,(b) Prevention of plastics entering waterbodies through collection and recycling of agricultural plastic film;  and 
219,(c) Reduced nutrient runoff via improved management and utilization of livestock/poultry manure.

In addition to the benefits of reduced water  pollution loads and more efficient wastewater operations, activities supported by Results Area 3 are  expected to contribute to reduced GHG emissions.79  "
221,"27. Results areas are aligned with, and supported by, the activities undertaken as part of the Central Basin IPF, as  part of the YRPERP’s nested hierarchy design. The Central Basin IPF supports the operationalization of the RCS  collaboration mechanism at the Basin level, with Results Area 1 supporting the connection of provincial-level RCS data  platforms to the basin-level RCS platform to be established by the CWRC. The Central Basin IPF also supports research  aimed at informing and harmonizing provincial-level guidelines, regulations, and policies while providing capacity building  and knowledge exchange activities that will support their implementation. The Central Basin IPF focuses its ecological  research activities and resulting management recommendations on Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake Basins (key  biodiversity hotspots and target areas under Results Area 2). Alignment of Program elements are further discussed in  Section IV. "
222,"28. Program financing. Total Program financing over 2022–2026 is expected to be US$6,526 million, of which an  expected US$6,126 million (93.87 percent) will be funded by the Government and US$400 million equivalent (6.13  percent) financed through IBRD (Table 1). Of the US$6,126 million Government financing, it is estimated that US$2,519  million will come from Jiangxi Province and US$3,607 million will come from Hunan Province. The IBRD loan will comprise  US$392.5 million equivalent as part of the PforR in support to the two sub-national provincial programs, with US$196.25  million for each province, and US$7.5 million equivalent for the Central Basin IPF. The proposed PforR will exclude high- risk activities with potentially adverse impacts on the environment and or affected people. In addition, it will exclude "
223,"  78 Four specific contributions to climate adaptation and mitigation are envisaged under Results Area 2: (1) Ecological flows maintain ecosystem  function and provide habitat, expanding thermal refugia by providing microclimates that buffer organisms from the impact of heat, and aid in  building ecological resilience to extreme events such as floods and droughts. They also contribute to increasing terrestrial and aquatic carbon sinks.  (2) The Gan River Water Environment Information Platform will collect climate-related data to support management to mitigate the impacts of  climate extremes on target riverine ecosystems. (3) Integrated water environment plans for the sub-basins will include specific chapters on climate  change impacts and potential management responses. These plans will incorporate climate considerations (for example, flood risks) in their  infrastructure investment recommendations. (4) Ecological flows will promote stability in water levels, reducing methane emissions and thus  generating mitigation benefits (see Rosentreter, et al. [2021], link). All four results are due to actions under DLI.2.  79 Net emissions reductions from Program-supported activities within the demonstration counties (DLI.3) include mitigation (net) of 25,705 tons  CO2-e annually from improved wastewater treatment; and 13,244 tons CO2-e annually from utilization of livestock/poultry manure, for total net  emissions reductions of 38,949 tons CO2-e annually and 584,239 tons CO2-e over 15 years.

234,"32. The Program’s DLIs quantify the parameters and values that need to be achieved to trigger disbursements  (Table 2). Each province is responsible for measuring achievement of DLIs within a consistent framework allowing for  aggregation and reporting at the Program level. DLIs that were chosen (a) represent improvements in key aspects of the  Government program and the key priorities in each results area; (b) are within the control of the Government; (c) are  achievable in the Program period; and (d) are verifiable. They prioritize the use of existing indicators and reporting  mechanisms within the Government system where possible, to ensure sustainability. "
235,"33. Verification will be carried out on an annual basis by a third-party agent based on data collected by the  provincial and county agencies. At the county level, inspection will be conducted by the county Program Management  Office (PMO) on behalf of the county government; at the province level, sample inspections will be conducted by the  Provincial PMO (PPMO) on behalf of the provincial government. County-level inspections will cover county-level Program  activities; provincial-level inspections will randomly select a percentage (differing by activity) of the reported  accomplishments in the demonstration counties. The verification agencies will be contracted by the PPMOs using a  consistent and agreed verification protocol. The World Bank will review and provide feedback on the terms of reference  (TOR) for the verification agent, with the final agreement subject to confirmation of acceptability by the World Bank. The  Program verification procedures and implementation arrangements are to be detailed in an M&E plan for the Program. "
236,The purpose of this DLI is to improve the effectiveness of the RCS as a mechanism for cross- sector coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation through information sharing.

DLI 2 is a composite  index with a series of discrete actions with recurrent compliance monitoring, including (a) approval of water environment  protection plans covering the demonstration sub-basins (Gan River in Jiangxi and Yuan River in Hunan); (b) establishment  of a water environment information platform (Jiangxi) or issuing technical guidelines on data connection for the RCS  information platform (Hunan); and (c) implementation of ecological flows (meeting defined flow targets) on the  mainstream and major tributaries, in each of the two demonstration sub-basins. "
246,"• Verification: Public disclosure of the integrated water environment management plans will be required for  verification, along with publication of monthly ecological flow monitoring bulletins. This information, plus  the status of the information platform (in Jiangxi supporting data sharing and decision-making) and public  disclosure of the Technical Guideline on data connection for the RCS information platform (in Hunan), will  be collected by the DEE and the RCO in the two provinces, respectively, and verified through the verification  agency. "
247,36. DLI 3: Reduced pollutant loads entering waterways in demonstration counties. DLI 3 includes three sub-DLIs that  are aimed at reducing plastic and point and non-point source pollution in waterways and mitigating GHG emissions: 
248,"• DLI 3.1 (improved township domestic wastewater service systems) is defined by (a) integrated wastewater  management strategies issued considering institutional arrangements, financial sustainability, plant and  network operations and maintenance (O&M), climate resilience, social inclusion and low-carbon  technologies, among others; (b) integrated institutional arrangements for plant and network O&M; (c) COD  reductions (that is, plant efficiency) that increase annually during project implementation at WWTPs due to  improved utilization of plant capacity. "
249,Verification: Confirmation of integrated wastewater systems is based on (a) county-level integrated  wastewater management strategies are publicly disclosed at county government websites; (b) valid  contracts of integrated county wastewater collection and treatment; (c) verification of COD concentrations  according to environment bureau real-time monitoring data records. 
250,• DLI 3.2 (plastic waste (agricultural plastic film) prevented from entering water bodies) is defined by the  quantity of agricultural plastic film recovered through plastic collection. Plastic film is a major contributor to  waterborne plastics pollution.

"
252,• DLI 3.3 (demonstration counties meeting annual targets for manure utilization) is defined by the number  of counties meeting their annual livestock and poultry manure utilization ratio targets (%) in the  demonstration counties. Unutilized and improperly managed manure is a source of NPS water pollution and  GHG emissions. Utilization of manure includes generation of biomass energy and use as organic fertilizer on  fields (a partial substitute for GHG-intensive synthetic fertilizer). 
253,"Verification: Regular data on the quantities of livestock and poultry manure produced and utilized are  reported in the direct reporting system of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA). Reported  quantities will be verified based on random sampling of large-scale farms83 and other supporting documents  (for example, inspection reports from the county agricultural bureau) by the verification agencies.

256,"37. In addition to underpinning the PDO across the three results areas, all DLIs contribute to the Program’s climate  change adaptation and mitigation benefits. RCS data platform connections (DLI 1), as well as the Gan River Environment  Information Platform (DLI 2) will support the sharing of climate-relevant hydrological and ecological data necessary for  coordinated climate-sensitive management actions, strategies, and plans; integrated water and environmental  management plan for the Yan River (DLI 2) will include climate impacts and management responses and incorporate  climate considerations (for example, flood risks) in infrastructure investment planning; ecological flows (DLI 2) are  expected to increase resilience to temperature extremes and drought, as well as mitigate low-flow related methane  emissions and build up carbon stocks; Integrated Wastewater Management Strategies will include options for treatment  plant resilience measures (for example, for site selection in the context of flood-related risks) and low-carbon technologies  (for example, installation of energy management systems) (DLI 3.1), while county-level investments will deliver substantial  GHG mitigation through improved wastewater service systems and utilization of manure waste to replace chemical  fertilizer use (see footnotes 77 and 78 and para. 64). DLI-supported adaptation and mitigation is further supported by  actions under the broader Results Framework and the Central Basin IPF (see para. 25). "
257,"38. A Program Steering Committee (PSC) will be led by the Office of the Leading Group for the Development of the  Yangtze River Economic Belt under NDRC (YREB Coordination Office). The YREB Coordination Office works in  coordination with other NDRC departments, notably Rural Economy, Environment and Natural Resources, and Regional  Revitalization, to promote implementation of the national YREB strategy through policy formulation and high-level  planning.84 The PSC will be headed by a senior official of the YREB Coordination Office and comprise representatives from  the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MWR, MEE, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MHURD), and MARA,  among others, along with representatives from the participating provinces. The PSC will be responsible for providing  overall coordination and guidance. It will be supported by a CPMO and an expert advisory panel that will provide technical  support and expert advice to the PSC. "
258,"39. The Central Program Management Office (CPMO) will be hosted by the Changjiang (Yangtze) Water Resources  Commission (CWRC). The CWRC is a river basin authority under the MWR, with a mandate to undertake integrated water  resources management (including water conservation and allocation), basin planning, water infrastructure construction,  and scientific and policy research. The CPMO will be responsible for coordination, reporting, management, including  management of environmental and social (E&S) aspects, and M&E of the activities under the Central Basin IPF, the  provision of capacity building, support to the PSC, along with Program implementation support, including consolidated  Program reporting. The CWRC will host the CPMO given its alignment between its mandate and the Program objectives,  plus technical capacity, to ensure an integrated river basin approach. The CPMO may also select public institutes under  the CWRC to carry selected activities under the Central Basin IPF using eligibility criteria set forth in the Project Operations  Manual.85 "

The PPMOs are responsible for preparation of  provincial-level Program documents and Program implementation management. They will report to Provincial PSCs, which  will comprise senior representatives from relevant departments, with similar structure and mandate as the national PSC.  Similar implementation arrangements will be set up at each demonstration county. "
263,"41. An M&E plan will be prepared, specifying the unit of measurement, baseline value, targets, and data sources  for each indicator, along with the methodology and responsibility for data collection and reporting. Existing government  systems based on the relevant technical guidelines applied by authorities at all levels will be used for results measurement;  these systems have proven effective at documenting the achievements and impacts of a wide range of ecological  protection and water pollution control measures under other (World Bank and non-World Bank) projects. The CPMO and  PPMOs will prepare and submit semiannual progress reports (including M&E reports), a mid-term review report (expected  no later than October 31, 2024), and a Program Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) by Program close.  Reporting on the Program will be consolidated by the CPMO based on reports from the PPMOs and the relevant  implementation agencies responsible for the basin activities and submitted to the World Bank for review. The consolidated  mid-term review report and the completion report covering the Program will also be submitted by the CPMO to the PSC  for strategic guidance. "
264,"42. The M&E system will draw on the capabilities of departments experienced in M&E within their area of  responsibility. Verification protocols will be based on existing Government technical guidelines, supported through a  strengthened verification system of random-sample inspections and field surveys (see section II on DLIs and verification).  The PDRCs are responsible for fund allocations based on an evaluation of county achievements, which relies on data  provided by sector departments. The PDFs are responsible for monitoring the management and disbursement of funds.  The respective DWRs are responsible for monitoring ecological flow compliance and providing data on water resource  management, DEEs are responsible for monitoring water quality, DHURDs are responsible for monitoring wastewater  services, and DARAs responsible for agricultural plastic film and NPS pollution.

Both Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces have indicated that they would like to apply for a 25 percent advance  payment (US$49.0625 million for Jiangxi Province and EUR 42.125 million for Hunan Province) under the PforR. The  amount of the advance will be deducted from the total amount due to be disbursed when the DLIs are achieved, and the  World Bank will record an amount of the advance as disbursed for an achieved Disbursement Linked Result (‘recovered’)  after it has notified the borrower of its acceptance of the evidence of achievement of the result for which the advance  was provided. The reclassified amount will become available for further advances. The cumulative disbursement in the  first two years after Board approval is not reasonably expected to exceed 60 percent of each IBRD loan based on the  amount of the advance, along with the DLIs expected to be achieved in the first two years of implementation, the timing  of the annual verification cycles (which will need to be completed before disbursements against achieved DLIs), and the  disbursement schedule of the Basin IPF. Accordingly, the IBRD loan for this operation is not deemed as fast disbursing.  The World Bank requires that the borrower refund any advances (or portion of advances) if the DLIs have not been met  (or have been only partially met) by the Program closing date. If by the end of the Program, the PforR financing amount  disbursed exceeds the total amount of Program expenditures, the borrower refunds the difference to the World Bank. "
267,"44. The PPMO will be responsible for consolidating reports from provincial agencies participating in the PforR and  submitting to the PDF, copying the CPMO. Disbursements will be made annually upon verification of the results of the  DLIs (see section II on DLIs and verification). The PPMO will submit a verification letter with the results to the World Bank  and, upon acceptance of the verification results by the World Bank, the PDF will prepare disbursement applications and  submit them to the World Bank. The applied disbursed amount will depend on the verified results. Some annual allocations  are scalable and non-fixed, meaning that the World Bank will disburse for over-performance up to the DLIs’ total allocation  (see annex 2). Over-performance will enable the PDF to bring forward disbursements from Year 4 and 5 to Years 2 and 3.  The PDF can apply for disbursements as soon as the province meets targets, provides the necessary evidence to the World  Bank, and the World Bank accepts that evidence in a formal notice to the borrower with the disbursement amounts. The  PDF can also ask to be reimbursed for any results achieved beyond the indicative annual target up to and not exceeding  the total PforR target and amount allocated for those DLIs that are scaleable and confirmed by the World Bank. A  Designated Account (DA) for the Jiangxi PDF will be set up in US dollars, while a separate DA will be set up for Hunan PDF  in euros.  "
268,"45. Technical capacity is generally strong but will benefit from capacity building in select areas. The technical  assessment (see section IV) has identified areas requiring strengthening which are reflected in actions captured by the  Results Framework. These include development of a public engagement manual for river chiefs with details on the roles  and responsibilities of all parties, increasing gender inclusion, capacity building, technical support, the means for inclusion  of local knowledge in decision-making, and provisions for citizen feedback and increasing gender inclusion. The  development of strategic plans for sustainable wastewater services by counties is intended to improve their operational  efficiency, with training on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste management for farmers aimed at improving  water pollution control. Provinces are responsible for these measures. The Central Basin IPF will also provide capacity  building on technical topics, including indexes for monitoring river health, and the determination, monitoring, and  supervision of ecological flows, through workshops and study exchanges. "
269,"46. The participating provinces are experienced with IPF projects but have less experience with results-based  financing in the water and environment sector. Fiduciary and E&S assessments have identified needs including  strengthened occupational health and safety (OHS) procedures and management for temporary workers in relation to  construction and facilities operation, strengthened monitoring mechanisms on livelihood restoration for those affected  by land acquisition, strengthened community engagement and public consultation, and strengthened grievance redress "

271,"recording systems. Training on the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and the related standards applications will  be provided to the CPMO for implementation of the Central Basin IPF, as this is the first time the CPMO has used the ESF.  "
272,"47. The technical assessment has established a sound PforR boundary. The Program is embedded within the  Government’s national program for the YREB at the central basin level and within the sub-national programs at the  provincial level. These provide a nested hierarchy of activities and objectives, aligned with administrative responsibilities  of the different levels of government and the provisions of the Yangtze River Protection Law (see section I). The law’s  passage was a key step toward ecological protection and restoration of the Yangtze River and reflects the importance  placed by the Government on the strategy for the YREB. The activities supported by the Program contribute to  implementation of the law and more broadly to the YREB strategy. The two provinces are critical to outcomes in the  Yangtze River Basin and have signaled their commitment to the national strategy through their subsidiary plans (see  Program Description, section II). Provincial plans have targets aligned with the 14th FYP. In geographic terms, Jiangxi and  Hunan are key to the Basin's environmental outcomes with their location in the middle reaches of the basin, major source  tributaries, and high agricultural and industrial production. "
273,"48. The assessment confirmed the soundness of the activities and their connection to the Program's desired  outcomes. Three distinct but complementary sets of activities are included in the design (see section II) that are integral  to the Government program: improvement of institutional mechanisms for coordination around ecological protection and  water pollution control (Results Area 1); enhanced integrated water environment planning and ecological flows in target  sub-basins (Results Area 2); and activities that contribute to reduce pollutants entering waterways (Results Area 3) (Figure  7). These are supported by the Central Basin IPF that will provide: (a) inter-jurisdictional cooperation and data sharing; (b)  research-based technical guidance related to key activities, such as guidelines for the evaluation of river health and  ecological flows, strategies for total phosphorous pollution prevention and control, and recommendations for the  systematic protection and restoration of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake; and (c) overall coordination and TA.

276,"49. The technical assessment found that cross-sector coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation—the focus  of Results Area 1—remain the most challenging task for improving basin management. The Program will support the  RCS, specifically its coordination platforms and data sharing. The RCS promotes water resources protection, shoreline  management, water pollution prevention and control, water environment management, and restoration of water  ecology.86 Under the RCS, each part of a river and lake is assigned to a particular official at the provincial, municipality,  county, and township levels, which helps address coordination and assignment-of-responsibility challenges between  departments and regions. With more than 1.2 million river and lake chiefs appointed, over 460,000 in the Yangtze River  Basin, this innovative system seeks to address the challenges of integrated water resources management (IWRM) and  water pollution control through promoting cross-sector coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation. The challenges  of cross-sector coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation have been recognized in previous World Bank  engagements with lessons derived for the present Program (Box 3). "
277,"50. Support for coordination mechanisms and data sharing platforms under Results Area 1 (and the Central Basin  IPF) is an important element of a more effective RCS. A basin-level collaboration mechanism for the RCS was established  by the CWRC in July 2021. The coordination mechanism revolves around the six main tasks of the river chiefs, with the  aim of promoting coordination among the 19 provincial RCOs and the CWRC, and is expected to facilitate joint planning  and coordination in policy implementation for river protection and restoration. Design of the mechanism was financed  through the World Bank TA project ‘Promoting Economic Reform and Capacity Building’. A working conference and  information management platform are to be established under the basin RCS coordination mechanism. The working  guidelines for the basin RCS coordination mechanism requires each of the provincial RCOs to strengthen cooperation and  coordination through the joint development, co-management, and sharing of information, with the CWRC to lead in  establishing a water-related information management system for the Yangtze River Basin. Each of the provincial RCOs is  required to establish a provincial-level RCS information management system and provide, maintain, and update  information in a timely manner to ensure the completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and availability of information and data  to promote the basin-wide information-sharing system and big data center. Data include sectoral planning (water, mining,  environment, waterway, and so on), water resources, water quality, water ecology, water emergency, and pollution  discharge licenses. The information platforms for the provincial RCOs will be connected to the national-level platform for  the inter-ministerial joint committee on the RCS administered by the MWR and to the basin-level information platform to  be developed by the CWRC. Counties and municipalities will connect their local river chief information platforms to the  provincial platforms as part of Results Area 1.  "
278,"51. The assessment confirmed a sound policy framework and rationale for integrated water environment  management planning and ecological flows—the focus of Results Area 2. The Yangtze River Protection Law commits  governments to determine, allocate, and monitor ecological flows for the Yangtze River's mainstream, major tributaries,  and important lake sections.87 The technical assessment indicates that the provinces are working on systems to determine  ecological water allocations, yet water allocation formulas are based on relatively simplistic hydrological indexes to  determine minimum flow requirements rather than detailed assessments of ecological requirements. The Program will  support the development and approval of basin-level guidelines for the determination of river health and ecological flows  as part of the Central Basin IPF. At the provincial level, the Program will support the monitoring and supervision of "
279,"  86 State Council and the CPC Central Committee. 2016. Opinions on Fully Promoting the River Chief Mechanism.  87 The law requires river basin management agencies of the water resources departments to include ecological water in the annual water allocation  plan to meet the basic ecological needs, ensure ecological flow during the dry season and fish spawning period, maintain the water volume and  level of important lakes, and maintain a balance of salt and fresh water in the Yangtze River estuary. The law also requires that water conservancy,  hydropower, and shipping hub projects on the mainstream and major tributaries of the Yangtze River, and in the upper reaches of important lakes,  incorporate ecological water allocations in daily operation and allocation procedures. Where the discharge does not meet the requirements of  ecological flow discharge, the water resources departments at or above the county level are required to determine and supervise corrective  measures.

281,"ecological flows. It will also support the development and approval of sub-basin or provincial-level instruments to reduce  pollution, including solid waste management plans and phosphorus management guidelines. "
282,"52. Results Area 3 supports activities that reduce pollutants entering waterways and complements other Program  components. Activities at demonstration county level include point source pollution control through improvements in  access and operations of township domestic wastewater collection and treatment services, along with NPSs of pollution  through improved management of plastic waste and increased utilization and management of animal manure. Article 46  of the Yangtze River Protection Law requires provincial governments to formulate a total phosphorus pollution control  plan and organize its implementation (supported by Results Area 2). The Central Basin IPF study on key pollutants will  focus on a basin-level assessment of total phosphorous as well as establish the thresholds of key pollutants flowing into  the Yangtze River, helping the provinces to set emission control targets in the provincial plan. These can help guide  provinces in preparing their own total phosphorus control plans, under an overall basin total phosphorus control target. "
283,"53. The Program’s interventions within demonstration counties—focused on wastewater services, the prevention  of plastics entering waterways, and increased use of organic fertilizers—are emphasized in the Yangtze River Protection  Law. Article 47 requires county governments to make plans for the construction of centralized sewage treatment facilities  and supporting sewer networks, to improve sewage collection and treatment capacities, and also emphasizes the need to  clarify responsibilities and implement unified management. The national 14th FYP for wastewater management calls for  promotion of integrated wastewater collection and treatment services. Similarly, Article 48 commits to strengthening the  prevention and control of agricultural NPS pollution, with the application of chemical fertilizers to be reduced, the use of  organic fertilizers to be promoted, and agricultural waste such as plastic films to be disposed appropriately. The dumping,  burying, or treatment of solid waste is forbidden within control areas for rivers and lakes in the Yangtze River Basin (Article  49), and the county-level governments are required to strengthen joint prevention and control of illegal transfer and  dumping. In addition to direct activities toward these requirements under Results Area 3, the Program contributes through  support for the provincial-level plans and guidelines for plastics and agricultural pollution management (Results Area 1). "
284,"54. Gender dimensions have been incorporated into the Program design to address gaps in participation and  decision-making roles in both the RCS and township wastewater utilities. These are based on preliminary assessments  in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces that show women are substantially underrepresented among both official and civil river  chiefs, with five or more male river chiefs for every female in the data sample provided by demonstration counties.88  Underrepresentation of women in these roles can influence the degree to which communities change pollution behavior,  the types of investments prioritized, and the women’s ability to gain experience and increase their job opportunities. To  address the gaps, the Program will include activities to improve engagement and awareness, along with methods to  increase participation, female voice and agency in the local RCS and wastewater utilities. A basin-level case study of the  RCS will analyze the extent and drivers of the gender gap, raise awareness among Government officials, and draw lessons  to refine program actions. A provincial public engagement manual to be developed as an intermediate outcome indicator  will include provisions to increase women’s participation and decision-making roles. Implementation of the manual will  contribute to the Program’s target of increasing female civil river chiefs from around 11 to 30 percent in the demonstration  counties. Activities to address key gender gaps in township wastewater utilities are based on the finding that women  represent less than 40 percent of technical and managerial positions and female staff earn a quarter less, on average, than  male staff among the sample survey. Gender stereotypes about leadership and decision-making and limited  implementation of the Women’s Development Plan are among the key drivers. To address these gaps, the Program  includes provisions to address obstacles in attracting, recruiting, retaining, and advancing women as part of the  wastewater management strategies to be developed by the demonstration counties under the related DLI. "
285,"  88 The responsibilities and roles of civil river chiefs play an important role in river management and protection, complementing the formal river  chiefs. The MWR issued ‘Implementation Opinions on promoting River Chief System’ requiring enhancing the role of civil river chiefs in promoting  river management policies, collecting public feedback, supervising river chief performance, and bridging communications.

287,Box 3. The World Bank's experience in strengthening institutions for the management of transboundary river basins 
288,"The YRPERP draws on lessons from a range of World Bank-financed programs and analytical work in transboundary river basins.  Although the Yangtze River is contained within China, it flows through 19 provinces, which have a high degree of autonomy in the  Chinese system. In combination with China's multi-tiered governance structure (national, basin, provincial, and local), this creates  challenges similar to those seen in transboundary contexts. In response, the YRPERP links financing to performance-based targets  that strengthen institutions for inter-jurisdictional cooperation and cross-sectoral coordination. Specific actions are aligned with  the functions and responsibilities of existing organizations through a nested hierarchy of activities at the basin, provincial, and local  levels, providing a Program framework aligned with the decentralized and polycentric nature of river basin management in China.  Key lessons were derived from the following: "
289,"• The Danube Water Program (P159654) illustrates the importance of institutional and policy support for strong utilities and  sustainable water and wastewater services. Since the adoption of the European Union Water Framework Directive, European  Union countries have used a river basin approach for water management, including the 19 countries that share the Danube  River Basin. The Program supports the basin countries by informing the policy dialogue and strengthening institutional capacity  through partnerships with regional, national, and local stakeholders. "
290,"• The Nile Basin Program (P156765) highlights the benefits of investing in data and information to support infrastructure  planning and development, as well as capacity building, in managing joint development of shared water resources. The World  Bank has been investing in the countries of the region for more than 20 years under a shared vision to cooperatively and jointly  develop shared water resources. Regional norms and processes have been established to share information and conduct joint  modelling to inform the prioritization, planning, and implementation of investment projects across the basin. "
291,"• The Ganga River Basin Project (P119085) provides an example of measures to address water pollution and strengthen basin  management. Building on an earlier World Bank project that financed sewage infrastructure in pollution hotspots along the  river, the project is building the capacity of the National Ganga River Basin Authority to establish management tools, investigate  environmental flow options, and collect and share data in a complex multi-state governance setting. "
292,"• The Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program (P100406 and P103298) illustrates the challenges of coordination  relating to environmental management in transboundary basins. The Program provided long-running support for collective  management and governance through policy, legal, and institutional reforms. These focused on environmental management  in pollution hotspots, mechanisms for cooperative management between the partner states, and environmental restoration of  degraded sub-catchments, highlighting the time required to realize results when addressing NPS pollution.  "
293,"• The Murray-Darling River Basin provides an example of basin-wide institutions and management tools to safeguard water for  the environment. Analytical work in partnership with the Australian Water Partnership has highlighted institutional  arrangements for the allocation and measurement of environmental flows (environmental water holders) in inter-jurisdictional  contexts. A Basin-wide Environmental Watering Strategy sets out objectives for river health, with water then allocated to  improve flows; water holders decide where and when environmental water will be delivered to achieve those environmental  objectives.   "
294,"• The Framework for Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water Sector in Mexico (P120134) was a Development Policy Loan  supporting the government's efforts to mainstream adaptation to climate change in the water sector by strengthening  institutions, creating water banks, regulations, and monitoring capacity in integrated water resources management, as well as  incentives to improve data collection and flows of information; establish watershed management programs to improve water  quality at sub-national levels; improve the productivity of irrigation; and, strengthen wastewater treatment to improve water  quality for groundwater recharge.  "
295,"These activities, set within complex inter-jurisdictional spaces with parallels to the Yangtze River Basin, have influenced YRPERP  activities on data sharing and coordination, integrated management planning, capacity building, environmental water allocations,  and the use of demonstration investments to influence cross-boundary outcomes. It is also expected that YRPERP experience will  similarly contribute to global knowledge on mechanisms for transboundary management in multilevel governance contexts (for  example, systems within federated states or under regional management bodies). The Chinese experience in complementing  infrastructure-led water sector development with inter-jurisdictional institutions for sustainable water management will be  valuable for World Bank clients looking to make a similar transition as their development needs evolve. "

297,"55. As the Program boundaries are established within the two sub-national provincial plans, the Program  expenditure framework is assessed at the provincial level. Implementation of the national YREB program is funded  through a range of instruments at the provincial and local level in accordance with the responsibilities for expenditures  on ecological and environmental protection issued in May 2020.89 The actions required to meet the objectives of the  Program are not linked to specific government budget allocations, with the YREB Development Plan calling on inputs from  a range of stakeholders, including all levels of government. Eco-compensation mechanisms include those specific to river  basins, forestry, wetlands, green supply chain and procurement, ecological industries, and green finance and are  recognized as some of the financing instruments that will help achieve the goals of the national YREB strategy and its  provincial subsidiary plans. The expenditure framework thus comprises multiple relevant budget lines rather than a single  Government program fund. "
298,"56. The expenditure framework in Jiangxi Province presents an adequate basis for the PforR. Implementation of the  ‘5-Rivers-1-Lake’ Plan is partly funded from the provincial government’s ‘River Basin Ecological Compensation Program’  (RBECP). This covers all 100 counties in Jiangxi, including over 90 counties in the Poyang Lake Basin. The RBECP is intended  to support ecological protection, water quality improvement, forest protection and improvement, and livelihoods. Each  county is evaluated against three sets of indicators annually: (a) water quality; (b) forest and ecological conservation; and  (c) water resource and water environment integrated management, with funds allocated according to results. An  estimated CNY 14 billion (US$2 billion) has been invested through the RBECP from 2016 to 2020 (averaging around US$400  million annually), including approximately US$1.4 billion from the central government through the National Key Ecological  Zone Program (NKEZP) supplemented through general provincial budget allocations and county contributions. These funds  increased substantially from 2016 to 2018 and stabilized in 2019 and 2020, despite the impacts of tax cuts and COVID-19  on fiscal revenues. According to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance, the RBECP funds will reach CNY 3,275 million  (US$500 million) in 2021 and will be maintained at least at this level during the 14th FYP period and beyond, based on  which it is estimated that the RBECP funds for 2022 to 2026 will amount to CNY 16,375 million (US$2,519 million). "
299,"57. The provincial program is managed by the Budget Division of the PDF with results evaluated by the PDRC with  support from sector departments. There is no program-based expenditure classification in China’s budget management  system, so the expenditures under the RBECP cannot be tracked precisely. However, the use of the RBECP funds can be  assessed through the annual self-review reports prepared by the counties.90 According to the self-review reports, most  local governments (65 percent) use the RBECP as earmarked funds, with some local governments (28 percent) blending  the RBECP with other financial sources at the county level. These show RBECP expenditures on water pollution reduction  (28.5 percent), water ecological management (13.3 percent), waste management (12.9 percent), rural and urban  environment improvement (13.3 percent), forest improvement (5.9 percent), and institution improvements (4 percent).  "
300,"58. The expenditure framework in Hunan Province presents an adequate basis for the PforR. Implementation of the  ‘Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin’ Plan is funded from a number of sources  covering the entire Dongting Lake Basin. From 2018 to 2020, roughly CNY 14 billion (US$2.16 billion) was allocated from  the central and provincial governments for water environment management in the Dongting Lake Basin. The total funding  increased significantly from CNY 4.3 billion in 2018 to CNY 4.8 billion in 2019 and CNY 4.9 billion in 2020. This indicates  that the source of funds for the Government program in Hunan Province is stable and guaranteed. These funds were  primarily from four programs (see annex 3). In 2018, the largest source of financing came from Rural Environment "
301,"  89 State Council General Office. 2020. The Reform Plan for Delineating the Functions and Expenditure Responsibility between the Central  Government and Provinces regarding Ecology and Environment Protection (Guo Ban Fa [2020] No. 13) (link).  90 Among the 100 districts and counties under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province, 97 districts and counties have provided the World Bank with self- examination reports on ecological compensation funds in the river basin. Except for the districts and counties under the jurisdiction of Jingdezhen,  the prefecture-level city, which provide self-examination reports in 2017, the other districts and counties provided self-examination reports for  2018. "
302,   The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
303,"Improvement from DARA, accounting for 43 percent of the total financing while Water Pollution Reduction from the DWR  made up the largest share (49 percent) in 2020. In terms of funding source by department (Table 5), DARA provides the  largest proportion (49.34 percent), followed by the DWR (37.70 percent) and DHURD (12.97 percent). The total  Government financing for the program during the program implementation period (2022 to 2026) is estimated at CNY  23,446 million (US$3,607 million) based on the average financing for the three years from 2018 to 2020. "
304,"59. The final expenditures related to water environment management in Hunan Province were determined through  an analysis of the statement of government final accounts for the past three years. According to the final account data,  about CNY 24.34 billion (US$3,760 million) was used on water environment management from 2018 to 2020. Almost 50  percent of the expenditures were used for ‘Water Pollution Prevention and Treatment’, which includes expenditures for  wastewater treatment plants and pipelines. This was followed by expenditures for ‘Rural Environment Management’  (24.58 percent), which includes rural wastewater treatment, waste management, and NPS pollution reduction. Those two  expenditures together (approximately CNY 17 billion) exceed the financing amount in the three years (CNY 14.07 billion),  indicating sufficient funding sources for the provincial program. Provincial commitments toward implementation of the  Government program under the 14th FYP (2021 to 2025) amount to CNY 37.12 billion (US$5.73 billion), of which CNY 7.41  billion (US$1.14 billion) is allocated toward investments in water supply protection, CNY 21.99 billion (US$3.40 billion)  invested in water pollution prevention and treatment, and CNY 7.72 billion (US$1.19 billion) invested in water ecological  protection and restoration, providing an adequate basis for this PforR. "
305,"60. Economic conditions in the provinces and the fiscal position of the provincial governments are sound and stable  (see annex 3). While the economic downturn in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted Government  finances, revenues are estimated to have recovered alongside economic activity in 2021. The budget allocation for the  Program’s activities accounts for around 1.0 and 1.2 percent of the general budget revenue in Jiangxi and Hunan,  respectively, so financial sustainability and continuity of program-related activities in the years beyond the Program are  not at risk. "
306,"61. Benefits from the Program are expected to accrue at both local and global levels. At the local level, increases in  biodiversity and vegetative cover can be expected, together with a decrease in pollutants in major waterways and thus  periods of eutrophication, which can be expected to improve the amenity value of rivers and lakes, recreation  opportunities, real estate values, fishery productivity, shipping services, and tourism and reduce costs of water treatment.  Global benefits will result from improved biodiversity, such as benefits to internationally migratory birds (Dongting and  Poyang Lake are important migratory bird habitats), reduced coastal eutrophication, and reduced marine plastic debris.  Climate benefits (GHG mitigation) will be derived from reduced eutrophication91 of lakes and waterways caused by  discharges of livestock waste and wastewater and displaced use of synthetic fertilizer, as well as from more efficient  wastewater treatment and collection systems. "
307,"62. To estimate the Program’s economic benefits, benefit transfer from available environmental valuation research  in China was used. The economic values of water quality and ecological improvement are challenging to quantify due to  the dispersed spatial extent of benefits across the basin, the wide range (and indirect nature) of benefit types, and data  limitations. However, four studies provide benefit estimations that can be adapted to the parameters of this program to  indicate its likely economic values. These studies utilize the contingent valuation method92 (CVM) to capture the broad  range of benefits (both use and non-use economic values) that are expected. Benefit estimates are incorporated into a  simple benefit-cost analysis (BCA), applied at the sub-basin level for Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake Basins. The "
308,"  91 Eutrophication, caused by excessive richness of nutrients, increases the emission of methane, which is 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at  trapping heat in the atmosphere (based on IPCC, AR5).  92 Contingent valuation method uses questionnaires targeted to affected populations to elicit their willingness to pay (WTP) for non-market  environmental goods such as avoidance or reduction of pollution impacts. It has been applied extensively to water pollution issues. "

310,"assessment implicitly combines activities under Results Area 1, Results Area 2, and Results Area 3 to value outcomes as a  combined water and environmental quality improvement. The assessment compares a ‘no program’ scenario to a scenario  of a Government program including World Bank support.93 "
311,"63. Upper and lower levels of program benefit, based on household WTP and adjusted for provincial population  and income, are compared to total program costs (Table 3). A lower bound on household WTP of 0.55 percent was used,  based on the lower range of available estimates. A 15-year period of analysis was used, with benefits starting in Year 5 of  and increasing to their full value within two years. Across scenarios, the program is economically robust at both 6 and 12  percent discount rates. Annex 2 contains further detail. "

314,"64. GHG emissions reductions of 0.58 million tons CO2-e are expected due to PforR Program activities (Table 4),  with an implied value (based on a shadow price of carbon) of US$17.9–36.3 million over the economic life of the  Program.94 Quantification of GHG emissions focuses on DLIs 3.1 and 3.3. Mitigation is assessed over 15 years and is  compared to a no-Program scenario (baseline). Upgrades to the wastewater network and treatment operations is  expected to reduce emissions due to leakage of wastewater to groundwater. The treatment and reuse of livestock/poultry  manure (through on-farm treatment facilities and organic fertilizer displacement of synthetic fertilizer) is also expected to  substantially mitigate emissions. This assessment does not include the expected emissions reductions through  institutional, policy, and planning measures95 nor through ecological restoration (due to challenges in quantifying these  reductions). The quantitative estimates presented here should thus be considered a lower bound on the Program’s GHG  mitigation. Annex 3 contains further detail. "

316,"65. Adequacy of the Program’s fiduciary systems. Pursuant to the World Bank’s Policy and its associated Directive on  PforR Financing of November 10, 2017 and June 20, 2019, respectively, as well as the World Bank’s PforR Fiduciary Systems  Assessment Guidance Note issued on June 30, 2017, the World Bank’s Fiduciary Team carried out a fiduciary systems  assessment (FSA). According to the FSA, and given the agreed actions to strengthen the fiduciary systems reflected in the  Program Action Plan (PAP) and other proposed mitigation measures that will be implemented, the Program’s fiduciary "
317,"  93 This approach is used because under a PforR, Government and World Bank funds are combined to achieve results, with limited distinction at the  activity level between World Bank-financed and Government-financed achievements.  94 The shadow price of carbon is set at US$38 per ton (lower bound) and US$75 per ton (upper bound) in 2017, increasing by 2.25 percent per year,  and applied to the quantified emissions reductions (in the form of an NPV) calculated here. See annex 3 for details.  95 Plans and policies under Results Area 1 and 2 also aim to drive water quality improvements (and are thus expected to reduce water-quality- related methane emissions, see Downing et al. [2021], link). "
318,   The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
319,"systems, including the financial management (FM), procurement, and governance systems, are considered to adequately  meet the requirements laid out in the World Bank’s PforR Policy and Directive. They provide reasonable assurance that  the Program’s financing proceeds will be used for the intended purposes, with due attention to the principles of economy,  efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability.  "
320,"66. Financial Management risks. Major risks identified include the following: (a) inadequate supervision on the usage  of Program funds by related provincial entities may bring potential risk of improper use of Program funds given that there  is no requirement for provincial governments to report Program expenditures in Hunan Province and the reporting  requirement stipulated in Government decrees have not been strictly implemented in Jiangxi Province; (b) the program  has no budget classification element and the required Program financial reporting cannot be generated from the  Government treasury system; and (c) Government auditors have thus far not audited program funds and have not  prepared any program audit reports. Although the proposed Program will be limited to the water and environment-related  sectors, a number of activities will be included, which is expected to pose challenges to the auditors when planning  Program audits.  "
321,"67. Mitigation measures for the major FM risks will include (a) developing a tailored format for Program financial  reporting drawing on the experiences of other PforR projects in China, designed and agreed on by the World Bank and the  PDFs; (b) the World Bank working with the Provincial Audit Office (PAO) to develop TOR to help coordinate Program audits; "
322,"and (c) outlining a pilot program for tagging Program related expenditures in the Government treasury system in the  Program Implementation Plan (PIP), allowing Program financial reports to be generated directly from the treasury system  and facilitate the external audit within the demonstration counties. "
323,"68. Procurement overview. The Government of China has a robust legal framework for procurement, which includes  the Tendering and Bidding Law of 1999; the Government Procurement law of 2003; and regulations and orders issued at  national, provincial, and county levels. Although the laws could be modernized and aligned to modern principles such as  ‘value for money’ and ‘fit for purpose’, both offer a fair playing field for bidders and promote transparency and  competitiveness. The Government has recently encouraged the use of electronic bidding. All open bidding competitive  processes are conducted by public resources transaction centers, which provide facilities and modern platforms for  processing procurement activities electronically. "
324,69. Procurement risks and mitigation measures. Four major procurement risks have been identified. 
325,"(a) Contracts may be awarded to firms or individuals that are debarred or under temporary suspension by the  World Bank or other multilateral development banks. The following mitigation measures are proposed: (i)  upon Program loan effectiveness, the Provincial Program Office shall issue a high-level official letter or  official instruction to require Program Implementation Agencies (PIAs) to ensure that no contract will be  awarded to ineligible firms or individuals; (ii) procurement staff at the PPMO are to check the latest list of  debarred and temporarily suspended firms and individuals before contract award to ensure contracts are  being awarded only to eligible firms or individuals; and (iii) the TOR for the annual external audit shall  include the task of randomly selecting contracts and assessing whether they have been awarded to an  ineligible firm or individual.  "
326,"(b) The World Bank may not be informed of fraud allegations and corruption issues during implementation. A  PIP shall therefore require the client to inform the World Bank of any credible and material allegations of  fraud and any corruption issues as part of the Program progress reports, as mandated in the Loan  Agreement.  "
327,"(c) In Jiangxi, the Price Commitment Method is widely used for bid evaluation by using the cost estimate as a  key reference for contract price determination. To avoid substantial deviation between contract price and "
328,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
329,"the prevailing market price level, the PPMO is required to regularly update the cost estimate by taking  account of market variants in a timely manner to ensure realistic value for money is being achieved.  "
330,"(d) Contracts may not be completed within the contractual completion time, and the contract completion  audit may not be completed in a timely manner. Human, financial, and policy resources should be allocated  by Hunan and Jiangxi PDRCs for close monitoring contract implementation progress to minimize or avoid  foreseeable cost overruns and/or implementation delays. "
331,"70. Fiduciary risk rating. Considering the abovementioned FM and procurement risks, along with the proposed  mitigation measures, the overall fiduciary risk rating is assessed as ‘Substantial’.  "
332,"71. Fiduciary supervision. Procurement and FM are subject to annual audit by government audit offices. Procurement  following the procedures of the Tendering and Bidding Law (TBL) is subject to regular supervision and oversight by DRCs  at various levels and relevant sector authorities (water, environment protection, agriculture, housing and construction,  land and natural resources). The Finance Department or Bureaus at various levels exercise regular supervision and  oversight for procurement following the procedures of the Government Procurement Law (GPL).  "
333,"72. Fraud and corruption risks. The Government has institutions in place to combat fraud and corruption. These  institutions are designed to prevent, report, detect, investigate, prosecute, and sanction fraud and corruption. These  institutions include the discipline inspection commissions within all implementation agencies, supervision bureaus,  anticorruption bureaus under People’s Procuratorates, and audit offices, all at central, provincial, prefectural, and county  levels. These agencies have comprehensive mandates to combat fraud and corruption. Any bidder or any party can report  fraud and corruption issues to any of these government agencies. The World Bank’s right to conduct an inquiry into such  allegations or other indications, independently or in collaboration with the borrower regarding activities and expenditures  supported by the Program, as well as its right to access to the required persons, information, and documents will be  observed in accordance with the standard arrangements for this purpose between the Government and the World Bank.  The Program’s Legal Agreement will also oblige the client to fully comply with obligations under the World Bank’s Anti- Corruption Guidelines for PforR operations. "
334,"73. An Environmental and Social System Assessment (ESSA) was conducted to provide a comprehensive review of  E&S systems and procedures at the national level, as well as in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces. The review recommended  actions to address gaps and opportunities to enhance performance during PforR implementation. In addition, relevant  provisions of the World Bank ESF have been applied to the Central Basin IPF and an Environmental and Social Management  Framework (ESMF), a Stakeholder Engagement Framework (SEF), and an Environmental and Social Commitment Plan  (ESCP) prepared in accordance with the requirements of the ESF. "
335,"74. The ESSA was conducted according to the following methodology: (a) thorough screening of the potential  impacts from the activities to be supported by the PforR; (b) desktop review on E&S laws and regulations and procedures  related to managing the relevant Program activities at the national, provincial, and local levels; and (c) field visits to sites  of typical Program activities in selected counties, with extensive meetings and interviews with key stakeholders ranging  from implementing agencies to government officials at provincial, county, township, and village levels and representatives  of local communities. Observation and discussions during these visits provided a good understanding of the potential E&S  impacts associated with the Program’s activities and procedures and capacity of government departments for dealing with  such impacts, including measures adopted under relevant laws and regulations.  "
336,"75. The ESSA considers the E&S risk associated with the PforR Program to be substantial. The Program will have  significant and broadly positive E&S effects in the Program regions, including reduced wastewater, plastic waste, and  agricultural pollution; improved river and lake water quality; and ecological environment rehabilitation. E&S screening  was conducted on the proposed Program activities to exclude those with the potential to cause significant adverse impacts "
337,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
338,"on the environment and or potentially affected people, including (a) activities involving closure or relocation of livestock,  poultry, or aquaculture farming; (b) activities involving large-scale infrastructure construction; (c) activities that have  substantial impacts on river hydrology and ecology; and (d) activities involving the allocation or conveyance of water,  including inter-basin water transfers or other activities, that could result in significant changes to water quality or  availability. After applying these exclusion criteria, the Program will support pollution control and ecological restoration  activities including county- and township-level wastewater treatment plants and pipelines, agricultural plastic film  collection and recycling, waste treatment of existing livestock farms, and institutional and capacity building activities. The  main potential adverse impacts identified include construction-related impacts such as dust, noise, disturbance of water  bodies, soil erosion, wastewater and solid waste management, construction workers’ and community’s health and safety,  labor management, small-scale land acquisition or restricted land access, temporary land use; impacts during operation  such as effluent discharge of wastewater treatment facilities, safe operation of facilities, labor management issues,  workers’ health and safety, and safe application of fertilizers; impacts on farmers’ livelihoods; and also the potential  indirect downstream impacts of TA activities. These adverse E&S impacts are not significant and can be well identified and  readily avoided, minimized, and mitigated through mature technologies and good management practices. Neither OP 7.50  - Projects on International Waterways nor OP 7.60 - Projects in Disputed Areas is applicable to the Program. "
339,"76. The ESSA concludes that China has established a comprehensive system for the management of E&S issues at  both national and provincial levels, including in Jiangxi and Hunan Province. The system consists of laws, regulations,  guidelines, specifications, and standards principally consistent with the World Bank’s PforR Policy and Directive. This  system provides an acceptable basis for addressing the possible E&S issues related to activities supported under the  Program.  "
340,"77. The ESSA recommends that the PforR be used as an opportunity to strengthen the E&S management capacity  of different stakeholders. This could be achieved by (a) providing training on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste  management to farmers; (b) establishing a sustainable incentive mechanism to increase collection rate, in which the  existing jobholders should be appropriately considered, for example, the village cleaners; (c) enhancing the OHS  management of the enterprises involved in the Program activities; and (d) establishing a social impacts and risks screening,  public participation, monitoring, and reporting mechanism. To implement these recommendations, three actions have  been included in the Program Action Plan (PAP): (a) provincial and county agriculture and rural affairs bureaus shall provide  trainings on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste management to farmers; (b) PIAs shall strengthen OHS training  and regular health checkup for all in-service workers, including temporary workers; and (c) PIAs shall establish a social  impacts and risks screening, public participation, monitoring, and reporting mechanism and strengthen information and  record management in social risk management. "
341,"78. Consultation and information disclosure. Relevant stakeholders, including both government departments,  enterprise representatives, and local communities, were consulted through meetings and field visits to selected counties.  The draft ESSA report was shared with the Jiangxi and Hunan PPMOs and selected counties (six counties of Dayu, Chongyi,  Yugan, Yongfeng, Fuliang, and Yudu in Jiangxi; four counties of Shimen, Ziyang, Miluo, and Yuanling in Hunan), and  consultation workshops were carried out with the key stakeholders at the provincial and county levels. The participants  voiced their support in implementing the proposed Program and concurred with the findings and recommendations of  the draft ESSA, which were considered relevant and valuable for strengthening the actual effectiveness of the  implementation of the existing E&S system. Some participants provided valuable opinions to improve the accuracy of the  ESSA description in local context, which have been reflected in the revised ESSA. The draft ESSA was disclosed on the  World Bank’s website on November 1, 2021, and on the two provincial websites on November 4, 2021. "
342,"79. The E&S risks associated with the Central Basin IPF are rated Substantial. The relevant provisions of the ESF  apply. The Central Basin IPF is not anticipated to support any physical activities but consists of basin studies on river health  and ecological flows, baseline studies and development of guidelines related to key pollutants such as phosphorus,  research to inform implementation of the Yangtze River Protection Law, capacity building, institutional coordination "
343,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
344,"mechanisms, and information management, along with the compilation of Program results and reporting. Implementing  the Central Basin IPF is assessed to have moderate social risks. The potential risk relates mainly to health and safety risks  to field workers (for example, researchers) and inadequate consultations with stakeholders and are not considered likely  to cause any direct adverse environmental impacts. There could be basin-wide downstream E&S implications related to  the implementation of the products or outcomes of the TA. The downstream E&S impacts could include environmental  impacts from new construction, rehabilitation, and operation of wastewater and solid waste collection and treatment  facilities, labor risks, community health and safety, restrictions on land use, resettlement, and exclusion risks for  vulnerable groups, among others. The overall environmental and social risk classification (ESRC) is thus rated as  Substantial.  "
345,"80. The relevant provisions of the World Bank ESF have been applied and the relevant instruments disclosed. An  ESMF, an SEF, and an ESCP have been prepared for the Central Basin IPF in accordance with the requirements of the ESF  and disclosed on July 25, 2021.96 Both the ESMF and the SEF provide operational guidance for applying relevant  Environmental and Social Standards (ESS) to TA activities, creating added value for enhancing the operationality of policy  recommendations while incorporating considerations on significant E&S risks. The ESCP documents the material E&S  measures and actions to identify, assess, and mitigate E&S risks and impacts (including downstream risks) in connection  with the TA activities. The updated and final ESF instruments (including ESMF, ESCP, and SEF) have been cleared and  disclosed by the World Bank and have been redisclosed locally on November 8, 2021. "
346,"81. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected as a result of a Bank supported PforR  operation, as defined by the applicable policy and procedures, may submit complaints to the existing program grievance  redress mechanism or the WB’s Grievance Redress Service (GRS). The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly  reviewed in order to address pertinent concerns. Affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the  WB’s independent Inspection Panel which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WB non- compliance with its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time after concerns have been brought  directly to the World Bank's attention, and Bank Management has been given an opportunity to respond.  For information  on how to submit complaints to the World Bank’s corporate Grievance Redress Service (GRS), please visit  http://www.worldbank.org/GRS. For information on how to submit complaints to the World Bank Inspection Panel, please  visit http://www.inspectionpanel.org. "
347,"82. The overall risk is rated Substantial. The risk assessment is informed by the results of the technical, fiduciary, and  environmental and social systems assessments, with a summary of substantial (or higher) risks provided below. "
348,"83. The technical design risk is rated Substantial. The Program’s focus on improving cross-sectoral coordination and  inter-jurisdictional cooperation poses a technical risk given the involvement of multiple levels of government and line  agencies. Challenges around cross-sectoral coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation motivated the 2018  ministerial reforms (see section I), and the Yangtze River Protection Law recognizes the importance of an integrated  approach to river basin management and ecological protection. While the law calls for the establishment of a National  Coordination Mechanism, this mechanism has not yet been confirmed and there remains some ambiguity about the roles  and responsibilities of the various agencies, with coordination and information flow challenged by existing governance  structures. The Program attempts to address this risk through its support to coordination measures (specifically Results  Area 1), as well as through construction of DLIs aligned with existing well-defined areas of responsibility. "
349,84. The risk related to sector strategies and policies is rated Substantial. The Program is informed by a  comprehensive set of Government strategies and programs with high-level political support. The YREB Development Plan 
350,   The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
351,"is a high-level program that calls on inputs from a range of stakeholders, including all levels of government, but is not  linked to specific government budget allocations. While the boundaries of the YREB are broad, including a wide range of  potential activities implemented through various stakeholders and financing mechanisms, it is the sub-national provincial  programs that form the Government program, a sub-set of which is supported by the PforR. The boundaries of the PforR  have been clearly defined within the context of the sub-national provincial programs and screened to delineate the  boundary between those in the PforR and those outside its perimeter. The support at the basin level is provided through  an IPF component, which also allows for clearly defined activities. Institutional coordination and cooperation remain a  challenge to efficient implementation of sector strategies. Limited data sharing between institutions and narrowly defined  institutional mandates makes cross-sectoral implementation of policies challenging, and it is assumed that provincial  policies developed and approved under the Program will be enforced and not contradicted by county- or municipal-level  actions. Strengthening the RCS relies on a number of different stakeholders, along with the establishment and integration  of management information systems, to inform a number of actions that can deliver on the expected outcomes  improvements in inter-jurisdictional cooperation at the basin level.  "
352,"85. The implementation capacity risk is rated Substantial. Despite significant experience in IPF operations, there is  limited experience with results-based financing in the water and environment sectors. Preparation has focused on defining  simple DLIs that target priority outcomes and ensure sufficient cashflow. Training for provincial and local government  officials on the rationale and implementation of PforR has been used to improve understanding. Implementation capacity  is also a risk at the central level, where the implementing agency (NDRC) has limited human resources for day-to-day  oversight. Support from the CWRC is being used to mitigate this capacity risk.  "
353,"86. The fiduciary risk is rated Substantial. Fiduciary systems, including the FM, procurement, and governance  systems, are considered adequate to meet the World Bank’s requirements. Risks include the potentially weak capacity for  local governments to raise counterpart funds. In addition, the Government program has no budget classification element,  and the required Program financial reporting cannot be generated from the Government treasury system. Government  auditors have not yet audited the Program’s funds. A tailored format for Program financial reporting will be used drawing  on the experiences of other PforR projects in China, and the annual external audit process shall be used to ensure ineligible  firms or individuals have not received contracts. "
354,"87. The environment and social risk is rated Substantial. The Program will have significant and broadly positive E&S  effects in the target regions, and E&S screening has been conducted on the proposed Program activities to exclude those  that could cause significant adverse impacts on the environment and or potentially affected people. Central and sub- national governments have well-established systems for mitigating risks. Risks arise from the potential implementation of  products or outcomes of the TA, including the basin-level studies on water pollution and ecological protection and  province-level plans and policies. Such indirect E&S implications could include impacts from construction, rehabilitation,  and operation of wastewater and solid waste collection and treatment facilities, labor risks, community health and safety  risks, restrictions on land use, resettlement, and exclusion risks for vulnerable groups, among others. Risk mitigation is  provided by the ESF instruments prepared for the Central Basin IPF, the ESSA, and measures included in the PAP.  "
355,"88. The stakeholder risk is rated Substantial. The Program aims to improve institutional coordination, an ambition  that inherently faces stakeholder risks, given the need to coordinate and find consensus among disparate actors at  different levels of government. The Program’s design addresses this issue by supporting a coordination mechanism at the  basin level and promoting cooperation in data sharing and knowledge exchange. Program-supported activities rely on  cooperation of sector agencies. The role of the PDRC as the provincial-level counterpart and the use of results-based  financing that incentivizes action across sector agencies help mitigate this risk. "

698,"1. The Program is designed to address some of the key challenges facing IWRM in China. Complex problems exist  in interregional, intergovernmental, and inter-departmental collaboration, which reduces coordination and thus efficiency  of water resources and water environment management. The implementation difficulties of IWRM in China may be  ascribed to factors such as an amorphous definition, operational difficulties, departmental conflicts, and lack of defined  authority for river basin management.97 Recent institutional reforms in China are facilitating improved coordination and  cooperation. For example, the Yangtze River Protection Law, passed in 2020, provides a legal foundation for basin-specific  coordination in China and could be eventually transposed to other major river basins. It is the first legislation for a specific  river basin in China and infers specific obligations on the national agencies and provinces, delineates responsibilities, and  requires systems for information sharing and establishing of forums for knowledge exchange and decision-making  between jurisdictions. The River Chief System (RCS), implemented nationwide in 2016, is another example of an institution  that facilitates inter-jurisdictional cooperation. The system is formed by a network of officials, each responsible for their  own section of river but coordinated through sub-national and national forums and data sharing platforms that help create  a unified view of the basin. The ministerial reform of 2018 and the ministries that resulted are also important steps  forward, with complementary responsibilities for water management brought together. to the Program supports  implementation efforts related to these reforms through its nested hierarchy of activities across three Results Areas and  the Central Basin IPF. This annex summarizes the technical assessment, covering the Program’s boundary and definition,  expenditure framework, diagnostic of key challenges, and suitability of the activities to address these challenges (see full  Technical Assessment for further detail). "
699,"2. The PforR will support a subset of activities from the Government’s sub-national provincial programs for the  YREB as defined in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces. Supported activities contribute to ecological protection and water  pollution reduction goals contained in the provincial plans that themselves contribute to the overarching national plan.  The provincial plans represent the Government’s program (in conjunction with the province’s 14th Five Year Plans) and  contain a larger set of activities than the Bank’s Program; these activities are described (and screened for high risk  activities) in the full Environmental and Social Systems Assessment. The timeline for the PforR is 2022 to 2026, with 2021  the baseline year against which outcomes are measured. The Program’s geographic scope and demonstration counties  are described in Section II.C. "
700,"3. China has a highly decentralized fiscal structure, with responsibilities for providing public services decentralized  to sub-national governments. As of 2019, sub-national governments accounted for 85.30 percent of total public  expenditure. Tax rates for major taxes are set centrally with revenues being shared between different levels of  governments. In addition, significant shares of revenues are transferred from the central government to the provinces  and from provinces to lower-level governments, both as earmarked and general-purpose grants. These transfers are  generally adequate to cover the gap between revenues and recurrent expenditures at the sub-national level. Counties  receive transfers from upper-level governments and play a key role in providing public services to the residents. The  expenditure responsibility between the central government and provinces and in turn between province and county  governments were further delineated during the 13th FYP, helping to increase clarity around SNG mandates and  accountability. Notably, the high degree of fiscal decentralization mean that many substantial national programs do not "

704,"4. The Program’s hierarchical design is aligned with the responsibilities for ecological and environmental  protection are divided at central, provincial, and local levels. According to the Reform Plan for Delineating the Functions  and Expenditure Responsibility between the Central Government and Provinces regarding Ecology and Environment  Protection,98 national-level ecological environment planning, policy and law making, implementation monitoring,  management, law enforcement, and capacity building has been classified as a central functionality; prevention and control  of water pollution in key basins such as the Yangtze has been classified as shared functionality; and local-level ecological  environment planning, policy and law making, implementation monitoring, management, law enforcement, and capacity  building, as well as the prevention and control of agricultural and rural pollution, solid waste pollution, chemical pollution,  groundwater pollution, and other local air and water pollution, has been classified as local functionality. Following such  principles, the Program activities for Results Area 1 and Results Area 2 will be financed by the provincial governments with  support of the central government, and the Program activities for Results Area 3 will be financed mainly by county  governments with support of the provincial government.  "
705,"5. Total Program financing over 2022–2026 is expected to be US$6,526 million. An expected US$6,126 million  (93.87 percent) will be funded by the Government and US$400 million (6.13 percent) will be financed by IBRD loan (see  Section II.C). Of the US$6,126 million government funding, it is estimated that US$2,519 million will come from Jiangxi  Province and US$3,607 million will come from Hunan Province. The IBRD loan will comprise US$392.5 million as part of  the PforR in support to the two sub-national provincial programs, with US$196.25 million for each province, and US$7.5  million for the Central Basin IPF. The Program Expenditure Framework is defined at the Provincial level, through the Jiangxi  – River Basin Eco-Compensation Program, and budget lines associated with the Hunan - Integrated Water Environment  Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin.  "
706,"6. In November 2015, Jiangxi Province initiated the RBECP, defined by the ‘River Basin Ecological Compensation  Methods in Jiangxi Province (for Trial Implementation)’ (The Methods). The Program covered 100 counties in the Poyang  Lake basin including its five major tributaries of Gan, Fu, Xinjiang, Rao, and Xiu. From 2016 to 2020, managed by the Jiangxi  PDF, about CNY 14 billion (US$2 billion) of Government expenditure was channeled through the RBECP (averaging around  US$400 million annually, Table 3.1). The amounts grew substantially from 2016 to 2018 and stabilized in 2019 and 2020,  despite the negative impacts of tax cuts and COVID-19 on fiscal revenue. According to officials from the Jiangxi PDF, the  RBECP funds will reach CNY 3,275 million in 2021 and at least maintain this level during the 14th FYP period and beyond.  Therefore, the World Bank team estimates the RBECP funds in 2022 to 2026 will reach CNY 16,375 million, or US$2,915  million (using an exchange rate of 6.5:1). "

710,"7. The Program has a variety of funding sources and is relatively stable. Among the US$2 billion channeled through  the program between 2016-20, approximately US$1.4 billion was a general transfer from the central government and the  NKEZP, with the rest coming from the provincial general budget and contributions from the counties (Figure 3.1). Funds  allocated by the central government accounted for the highest proportion, more than 60 percent since 2017. This suggests  that the source of funds for the RBECP in Jiangxi Province is relatively stable and guaranteed. "

712,"8. Expenditure of the RBECP is aligned with the proposed Program activities. According to The Methods issued in  2015 and amended in 2018, the RBECP funds should be mainly used for ecological protection, water environment  management, improvement of people’s livelihoods, and related activities. There is no program-based expenditure  classification in China’s budget management system, so the expenditures arranged from the RBECP funds cannot be  tracked precisely. Based on self-review reports, most local governments (64.95 percent) use the RBECP as earmarked  funds, and a small proportion of local governments (27.84 percent) blend the RBECP with other financial sources at the  county level. As shown in Figure 3.1 (right), of all the RBECP spending, the expenditures on water pollution reduction  accounted for 28.5 percent, water ecological management for 13.3 percent, waste management for 12.9 percent, rural  and urban environment improvement for 13.3 percent, forest improvement for 5.9 percent, and institution improvement  for 4.0 percent. In general, the expenditure of the RBECP is aligned with the proposed Program activities. "
713,Hunan: Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin 
714,"9. In Hunan, the major Program activities—water pollutant reduction, water ecological restoration and relevant  institutional innovation—are covered by the ‘Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake  Basin’ (2018–2025). The Plan is financed by several sources of budget funding and covers the entire Dongting Lake Basin.  From 2018 to 2020, roughly CNY 14 billion (US$2.16 billion) was allocated from the central and provincial governments  for water environment management in the Dongting Lake Basin. The total funding increased significantly from CNY 4.3  billion in 2018 to CNY 4.9 billion in 2020. This suggests that the source of funds for the Government program in Hunan  Province is relatively stable and guaranteed. These funds were primarily from four programs (Table 3.3). In terms of  funding source by department, DARA provides the largest proportion (49.34 percent), followed by DWR (37.70 percent)  and DHURD (12.97 percent). The total program financing during the 14th FYP (2022 to 2025) is estimated at CNY 23,446  million (US$3,607 million) based on the average financing for the three years from 2018 to 2020. "

According to the  final account data, about CNY 17.6 billion (US$2,708 million) was spent on water environment management from 2018 to  2020. Almost 66 percent of the expenditures were used for ‘Water Pollution Prevention and Treatment’, which includes  expenditures for wastewater treatment plants and pipelines, followed by expenditures for ‘Rural Environment  Management’ (34 percent), which includes rural wastewater treatment, waste management, and NPS pollution reduction.  Those two expenditures together roughly match the financing amount in the three years (CNY 14.07 billion), indicating  sufficient funding sources for the Provincial Program. Provincial commitments toward implementation of the Government  program under the 14th FYP (2021 to 2025) amount to CNY 37.12 billion (US$5.74 billion), of which CNY 7.41 billion  (US$1.14 billion) is allocated toward investments in water supply protection, CNY 21.99 billion (US$3.40 billion) invested  in water pollution prevention and treatment, and CNY 7.72 billion (US$1.19 billion) invested in water ecological protection  and restoration, providing an adequate basis for this PforR.

725,11. Program expenditure efficiency focuses on whether the Program expenditures can achieve the desired targets  and realize value for money. The following mechanisms are supportive of efficiency: 
726,"• Funding Allocation Rule: RBECP funds are allocated to different counties according to four sets of indicators:  (a) performance in water environment improvement; (b) performance in forest quality improvement; (c)  performance in water resource management; and (d) the ecological importance of the county. Each year,  evaluation of those indicators is conducted by relevant departments and the results used to determine the  counties’ available amounts for the subsequent year. Therefore, the funding allocation rule provides a strong  incentive for the counties to achieve the desirable objectives set by the provincial government and helps  ensure value for money. "
727,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
728,"• Expenditure performance evaluation rules: In Hunan, expenditure performance evaluation rules have been  established and applied to all the earmarked funds, which help ensure value for money. So far, the team has  not been able to access the evaluation reports, so the effectiveness of the performance evaluation is still  uncertain. "
729,"• Higher Level Government Transfer Mechanism: Program financing in both provinces is targeted toward  lagging regions. According to self-reviewed reports from 76 counties in 9 municipalities in Jiangxi Province in  2018, the amount of the RBECP allocated to each county (cities, districts) has a significant negative  correlation with its economic development level and with the level of local government financial resources  (see Figure 3.2). The less developed the local economy is, and the less its fiscal revenues are, the greater the  amount of RBECP allocated. This is in line with compensation for the foregone development opportunity of  less-developed counties to protect their environment and ecology. "

732,"12. The overall financial situation in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces appears stable (Table 3.1 and Table 3.2). The  unfolding context associated with COVID-19 is expected to have negative short-lived impact on the Government finance.  The budget funding of the Program activities accounts for only about 1 percent of the general budget revenue in Jiangxi  (Table 3.1), so financial sustainability is not a major concern. Similarly, in Hunan, the overall financial situation is sound  and stable; it can also be seen that the budget funding of the Program activities accounts for only about 1 percent of the  general budget revenue in Hunan (see Table 3.6).

The  inefficiency of IWRM and the difficulty of implementing it in China may be ascribed to factors such as amorphous  definition, operational difficulty, departmental conflicts, and lack of authority in river basin management.99 Institutional  reforms in China are facilitating improved coordination and cooperation but require further operationalization and  deepening to deliver on their potential. "
775,"15. A focus of the Program is the RCS, a key institutional innovation that aims to address these challenges. Since it’s  formalization nationwide in 2016,100 more than 1.2 million river and lake chiefs have been appointed at provincial,  municipal, county, and township, and village levels. Each part of a river and lake is assigned to a particular official who is  responsible for addressing coordination and cooperation between departments and regions. There are six main tasks  focused on (a) water resources protection; (b) shoreline management; (c) water pollution prevention and control; (d)  water environment management; (e) restoration of water ecology; and (f) law enforcement. The results are included in  the administrative assessment of the officials in charge, providing career-related incentives and accountability  mechanisms, within a system that works across agency lines. River chiefs receive assistance and support from the River  Chief Office, which often sits within the related water agencies at the respective levels. The office is composed of chiefs  and key staff from major related departments. Regular river chief meetings bring sector department leaders together for  consultation and decision-making. "

These range from relatively simple  administrative systems to more sophisticated information platforms with decision-support functions supported by  physical monitoring networks and public participation.101 A national pilot-level platform has been developed, and a range  of provincial and local level platforms are being implemented on a trial basis. However, these often have limited  functionality and are only partially connected across different jurisdictions and levels of government. "
779,"17. A basin wide coordination mechanism for the RCS along the Yangtze River was proposed by the CWRC through  ‘Working Guidelines’ issued on July 26, 2021. When operating, the mechanism will bring together the 19 Provincial RCOs  and the CWRC for consultation and decision-making, including through a working conference organized by CWRV. The  coordination mechanism is supported by an office set up at the CWRC, headed by the Director of the CWRC RCO. Working  guidelines outline the mechanism’s intended key tasks, including research and policy development, data collection and  monitoring, sharing of experience, and public outreach.102 Design of the basin-wide RCS coordination mechanism was  supported through the World Bank-financed TA project ‘Promoting Economic Reform and Capacity Building’ and its  establishment included as part of the CWRC’s plan during the 14th FYP period for implementing the Yangtze River  Protection Law. "
780,"18. An information management platform is to be established under the basin RCS coordination mechanism. The  working guidelines for the basin RCS coordination mechanism requires each of the Provincial RCOs to strengthen  cooperation and coordination through the joint development, co-management, and sharing of information. Under the  provision of the working guidelines, the CWRC is to lead in establishing an information management system for the  Yangtze River Basin RCS. Each of the provinces is required to establish their provincial-level platforms, which should be  synchronized for basin-wide information-sharing. Each of the members of the coordination mechanism is required to  provide continuously updated data on sectoral planning (water, mining, environment, waterways), water resources, water  quality, water ecology, water-related emergencies, and pollution discharges, among others. Among other uses, these data  are important for climate-informed management decisions, policies and strategies including water management and  pollution control under flow extremes. The integration of the basin and provincial systems – the latter also drawing on the  local level systems – intends to eventually provide a comprehensive information basis for IWRM from county to basin  level. "
781,"19. The RCS also provides an opportunity to promote engaging the public in river protection and water pollution  control. The River Chiefs are active in organizing public awareness campaigns and education programs; appointing  nongovernmental river chiefs, inspectors, and cleaners; supporting volunteer groups; and setting up hotlines and mobile  applications for citizen engagement and feedback on the performance of their river chiefs.103 These efforts are to be "
782,"  101 For sophisticated platforms data include: (a) administrative functions relating to the river chiefs (river patrols, water pollution and illegal natural  resources exploitation supervision, reporting and resolution coordination, public participation); (b) water quantity data (precipitation, water level,  flow, hydrology information); (c) water quality data (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, ammonia nitrogen, total  phosphorus, total nitrogen, permanganate index, fluoride), (d) monitoring of soil and water conservation, illegal construction and solid waste  dumps; and (e) drainage and solid waste management (drainage networks, conveyance systems, sewage pipelines and pump stations). See full  technical assessment for more details.  102 Key tasks for the mechanism stipulated in the working guidelines include: (a) conducting studies to support planning of transboundary rivers and  lakes; (b) implementing the water resource management mechanism; (c) jointly promoting shoreline protection of the Yangtze River; (d) jointly  promoting water pollution reduction and eutrophication management; (e) jointly promoting river and lake ecological protection and restoration; (f)  jointly enforcing relevant regulations and policies; (g) establishing a monitoring network covering hydrology, water quality, water ecology, and so  forth; (h) establishing information sharing and river health assessment; (i) conducting joint research on key issues including water ecology  restoration technologies, horizontal eco-compensation and so forth; and (j) conducting information, education, and communication (IEC) activities  and improving public awareness.  103 For instance, the Guangzhou Water Affairs Bureau as a public WeChat account for Guangzhou water control complaints, through which citizens  report illegal activities or dirty rivers and lakes online and receive corresponding cash bonuses. Similarly, Deqing County, Huzhou City, Zhejiang  Province, initiated the Ecological Green Currency mechanism, which provides rewards for reporting. "

Public participation also  provides an opportunity to increase community awareness of climate change issues–including increased flood and  drought risks, water scarcity, and water quality implications. However, there are currently no systematic guidelines to  structure engagement of the public in efforts around ecological protection, water pollution control, and climate resilience  for the Basin overall or in many Basin jurisdictions.  "
785,"20. The challenges and opportunities identified for strengthening mechanisms for coordination and collaboration  have informed Results Area 1 and the Central Basin IPF. The RCS can be improved by the following: (a) Accelerated  implementation of the basin-level mechanism and working conference for better coordination between the river basin  organization and the provinces; (b) Integration and expansion of the data monitoring and information sharing platforms  for a holistic and real-time understanding of biophysical conditions and river chief operations; (c) Deployment of advanced  technologies such as remote sensing that can complement manual river patrols and provide insights for inter-jurisdictional  decision-making; (d) Use of third-party monitoring and verification to strengthen the accountability of the river chiefs; (e)  Development of guidance for public engagement in the form of manuals to share approaches and lessons across  jurisdictions, including for climate change awareness; (f) Greater focus on gender balance in river chief appointments,  both paid and voluntary. These actions have informed the construction of DLI.1 and other parts of the Results Framework. "
786,Results Area 2: Advancing Ecological Protection through Integrated River Basin Management 
787,"21. Functional riverine ecosystems and their biodiversity require that sufficient water is allocated for  environmental purposes. 104 China has conducted ecological flow practices for around 40 years but in limited ways. In  April 2020, the MWR issued an Opinion105 aiming to strengthen ecological flow practices by determining the ecological  flow targets for important rivers and lakes, establishing ecological flow monitoring and regulation systems, and setting  targets to ensure ecological flows for the mainstream and major tributaries of the Yangtze River by 2025. The Opinion  required the river basin commissions and local water departments to consider the ecological flow requirements as rigid  targets in water allocation. In July 2020, the MWR further announced a Working Plan,106 which set targets to determine  ecological flows for important rivers and lakes including those of the Yangtze River Basin. Determination of ecological flow  requirements for 52 rivers and lakes in the Yangtze River Basin was included in the tasks for the CWRC from 2020 to 2022,  including Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers in Hunan and the Gan, Fu, and Xin Rivers in Jiangxi. Jiangxi and Hunan are responsible  for determining the ecological flows for Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. "
788,"22. The Yangtze River Protection Law commits governments to increasing ecological water management in the  Yangtze River Basin (Article 31). The law requires water resources department to include the ecological water volume in  the annual water allocation plan to meet basic ecological flow demand of rivers and lakes, ensure ecological flow during  the dry season and fish spawning period, and to maintain water levels in important lakes. Jiangxi and Hunan provinces  have identified ecological flow requirements based on minimum flow methods,107 as well as augmented flow requirements  for some specific river segments flowing through important ecological areas. Regarding the Program’s sub-basins, the  overall water allocation plan for Hunan’s Yuan River was approved in November 2020,  108 and the plan for Jiangxi’s Gan "

792,"23. The effectiveness of ecological flows would also benefit from consideration of intra-annual variations. More  detailed water allocation plans are needed to determine the annual, seasonal, and monthly allocations required to ensure  ecological function, which rely on particular water cycles as much as minimum flows. This is particularly the case in the  context of climate change, which is expected to cause greater variability in flows and place pressure on aquatic ecosystems  that compounds other pressures such as human use and development. Water dispatch plans are required to manage basin  water use, jointly operate reservoirs, and respond to the emergencies of droughts and water contamination disasters,  balanced with these ecological needs. Ecological outcomes would also benefit from consideration of both water quantity  and quality requirements in allocation decisions. "
793,"24. Actions have been identified based on the assessment to strengthen ecological flows and integrated river basin  water environment management under the Program. These include: (a) Water resources allocation to the county level  as the basis for water withdrawal licensing; (b) Ecological flows implemented and monitored against minimum  performance standards; (c) Tailored river/lake ecosystem health evaluation guidelines developed by the provinces to  guide the determination of ecological flows, which will then be used for ecological flow supervision in the demonstration  sub-basins (this aims to extend minimum flow type ecological allocations for broader consideration of river ecosystem  health considerations in line with international practice); (d) An inter-provincial river chief cooperation mechanism to  strengthen integrated cross-border water environment management in the Yuan river;109 and (d) A dedicated ecological  environment management information platform for the Gan river, covering both water pollution control and ecological  protection and restoration, with decision support function for more effective operational management and supervision.  These actions inform the design of DLI.2 and other parts of the Results Framework. "
794,Results Area 3: Reducing Water Pollution and Transmission of Plastic Waste 
795,"25. The Yangtze River Protection Law requires governments to address point source and non-point source  pollutants. Article 47 requires counties to improve urban and rural wastewater collection and treatment capacities, clarify  entities responsible, and implement unified management of systems. Similarly, Article 48 commits governments to  strengthening the prevention and control of agricultural non-point source pollution, with the use of organic fertilizers to  be promoted and agricultural waste such as agricultural plastic film to be appropriately disposed. Support for counties  under Results Area 3 aims to address these priorities with a focus on phosphorus pollution, which has become the primary  pollutant in many areas of the Yangtze. The Yangtze River is among the top five major rivers globally most severely affected  by phosphorus110 with significant sources including fertilizer use, livestock and poultry operations, and wastewater. The  technical assessment found that phosphorus concentrations spike to levels beyond prescribed limits more frequently than  other pollutants in the Program’s sub-basins.111 Actions further support reduction of COD from wastewater and  agricultural plastics. "
796,"26. China has invested substantially in its wastewater infrastructure systems since 1996 and achieved nearly  universal coverage. The emphasis of China’s wastewater treatment now is to improve the quality of services as well as  the efficiency of investment by enhancing financial viability and leveraging private sector participation. Wastewater  collection is separated from wastewater treatment in many localities, resulting in large portions of the collection network "

799,"lacking sufficient funding for maintenance, which leads to low pollution concentration of intake water of WWTPs and idle  capacity of WWTPs.112 "
800,"27. Assessment in demonstration counties reveal that almost all the counties have sufficient wastewater treatment  capacity, but face efficiency and management challenges. Challenges include: (a) the domestic wastewater management  services are fragmented, with the treatment plants being managed by one entity, mostly outsourced private sector  operators, while the sewer network is managed by the county bureau or county-level public entity or company, resulting  in a lack of accountability for ensuring service quality; (b) influent concentrations (Biological Oxygen Demand [BOD] and  COD) to the treatment facilities are usually low as a result of the combined effect of incomplete collection networks and  household connections, mixed wastewater and stormwater drainage, and poor conditions of the existing network due to  deferred maintenance, resulting in many WWTPs operating at a low efficiency level; and (c) a lack of sustainable financing  with the costs of the domestic wastewater management services covered from two sources: (i) a wastewater service  charge paid by the customers that typically covers only the outsourced treatment service provider who is responsible for  the O&M of the WWTP and (ii) subsidies through budget allocations from the county finances, which are used for O&M  of the wastewater collection system and often limited to urgent repairs. The assessment also found gender gaps among  workers in the sector.113 "
801,"28. In response to these challenges, the Program supports actions to strengthen integrated wastewater  management services. Actions include: (1) Development of integrated wastewater management strategy in  demonstration counties, including financial sustainability, integrated O&M, employment equity, workforce roadmap for  women and climate resilience and low-carbon technologies; (2) Increased COD reduction (influent COD minus discharged  COD) at township-level wastewater treatment plants; and (3) Integrated institution agreements: one entity responsible  for O&M of sewer network and wastewater treatment plants. These actions define the design of DLI.3-1. Resulting  improvements of systems’ efficiencies (both plants and their sewerage networks) are expected to have GHG mitigation  benefits in addition to reduced water pollution.  "
802,"29. The Yangtze River is a major contributor to global marine plastic pollution. The Yangtze River Basin reportedly  transmits the largest total volume of marine plastics of any of the world’s rivers, with an estimated 0.33 (range 0.31–0.48)  million tons of plastic discharged into the East China Sea annually.114 The Government is tackling the plastic pollution issue  through investments in solid waste management, bans on the import of waste recycling materials, bans on some single- use plastic items, regulations on the use of agricultural plastic film, improved monitoring, reporting and supervision, and  promotion of eco-design and material recycling, among other measures. "
803,"30. Agricultural film is a major contributor to riverine and marine plastic pollution due to the lack of management  system, that is, collection and recycling, in rural areas. China has the world’s largest agricultural film consumption (2.6  million tons in 2015) and land coverage (around 20 million ha).115 The recycling rate of agricultural film is less than two- thirds.116 While agricultural film has important benefits in terms of water efficiency and crop growth, uncollected plastic  film waste in fields is negatively impacting land productivity. In 2017, MARA issued ‘Action Plan for Recycling Agricultural "
804,"  112 See NDRC and MHURD. 2020. “14th Five-year development plan on municipal wastewater treatment and reuse.” The plan points out that an  insufficient or ill-maintained wastewater network poses a challenge for China’s wastewater sector.  113 The team collected data from four rural wastewater treatment utilities. These were found to have policies for equal recruitment and pay, as well  as equal training opportunities for both male and female staff. However, on average, female staff earned 25 percent less than male staff, including  for women in managerial positions.

807,"31. The two main challenges are to provide adequate financial incentives to farmers for collection, and to establish  financially sustainable channels for recycling. The Program will provide support for activities that address these  challenges in support of high levels of collection and recycling in demonstration counties (see full technical assessment  for county-level baselines and targets). Agricultural plastic film collection and statistics systems will be established with  inventories made by the collection sites. Farmers, especially large-scale farmers, will be required to use standard  agricultural plastic films that can be recycled and reused. The Program (under Results Area 2) will further support  development of a Provincial M&E protocol for agricultural film collection and recycling in Jiangxi, as well as support the  implementation of the Provincial Implementation Plan for Strengthening Plastic Pollution Management in Hunan. "
808,32. China’s livestock and poultry subsectors is a major contributor of non-point sources of pollution. Animal manure 
809,"production amounts to nearly 4 billion tons per year in China,119 with untreated manure and wastewater from livestock  operations delivering pathogens, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), heavy metals, and drugs (antibiotics) into  waterways. According to the Second National Pollution Source Consensus (2010), COD discharge from the Livestock and  Poultry Breeding Industry amounted to 10.01 million tons, contributing 93.76 percent of agricultural pollution; total  nitrogen and total phosphorous discharges amounted to respectively 0.60 million and 0.12 million tons, contributing 42.14  and 56.46 percent of agricultural pollution. Cognizant of these and other challenges within the agriculture sector, MARA  issued the 2017 Notice of Five Actions for Green Development of Agriculture, including measures for: (a) improving  management of livestock manure; (b) replacing chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers; (c) encouraging straw  treatment; (d) recycling agricultural plastic film; and (e) aquatic biodiversity protection. "
810,"33. Collection, separation, treatment and re-use or safe disposal of manure is critical for addressing these pollution  challenges, and also contributes to GHG emissions mitigation. The collection and separation of animal wastes, proper  disposal of treated solids and liquids, and recycling (compositing organic fertilizers, or using for waste to energy in biogas  facilities) can have significant benefits. The resource utilization rate of animal manure in both Hunan and Jiangxi reached  their target of 75 percent in 2020. Treated animal manure was mainly used as a replacement for chemical fertilizers (which  could further reduce agricultural NPS pollution), as well as for producing gas and electricity, both pathways are effective  at reducing GHG emissions relative to manure disposal in waterways or anaerobic ponds. The 14th Five-Year Period calls  for (a) further increasing the resource utilization rate to 85 percent; (b) establishing a system of animal waste treatment,  processing, and returning to the field as fertilizer; and (c) attracting private financing through innovative modes, including  public-private partnership and other mechanisms. The county-level utilization ratio will be measured on farm sites as a  sub-DLI (DLI 3.3), with the aim of gradually increasing the level of animal manure utilization in selected counties and  maintaining the level of utilization where it is already high (no less than 80 percent). This intervention will be  complemented by the development and dissemination of a provincial agricultural NPS pollution management best  practice guidelines. Details on county-level production, utilization, and utilization target rates are presented in the full  Technical Assessment. "
811,"34. During the technical consultations with stakeholders, discussions were held followed by a survey and rapid  assessment to understand the gender issues around women’s participation in local river and lake management, especially "
812,"  117 For example, Hunan recorded a total of 83,792 tons of agricultural plastics in 2019, ranking 12th nationally and 5th in the YREB.  118 For example, Hunan has set a target for 80 percent recycling rate of agricultural film by the end of 2020 and almost complete recycling by 2025  with a complete agricultural film producing, selling, using, recycling, and management system established province wide. This will be led by DARA.  See Hunan PDRC and DEE. 2020. “Implementation Plan to further strengthen plastic pollution control.”  119 Based on statements by the Ministry of Agriculture (link). "

814,"the River Chiefs System (RCS), and women’s job opportunities at local wastewater treatment utilities. Preliminary data  was collected from the demonstration counties and the gender results chain below has been developed based on an  analysis of the data. "
815,"35. There are opportunities to close gender gaps in river and lake management. Based on data collected by the Bank  team from counties in Jiangxi and Hunan, women are underrepresented as river chiefs with a female to male ratio of 1:5  (Figure 3.3). An extreme example is seen in Yuanling city, in which the proportion of male to female river chief is 13 to 1.  In Milo County, less than 4 percent of the river cleaners are women. On average, 7 percent of river rangers and 19 percent  of river cleaners are women. Considering the types of investments prioritized under the project, where women may place  greater influence on raising the public awareness and mobilizing more effective public engagement as well as  communication, the smaller number of women in these roles limit the degree to which communities internalize behavior  change on clean water and pollution control. In the six demonstration counties in Jiangxi, the situation is similar for civil  river chiefs and river rangers, with respectively 7 percent and 11 percent of them being women. However, there is a much  better gender balance for the river cleaners in Jiangxi, with about 50 percent of the work done by women. "
816,"36. Gaps also exist at local water treatment utilities in both equal access to jobs and equal pay for the same types  of jobs. The rapid assessment found that women account for less than 40 percent of the technical positions and about  one-third of the managerial positions. In addition, female staff earn a quarter less than male staff in average in Hunan.  This is particularly true for women at managerial positions. Disaggregated data by location further shows diversity among  the utilities. These rural water treatment utilities reportedly have policies for equal recruitment and pay, as well as equal  training opportunities for both male and female staff. However, the identified issues in equal employment opportunities  and equal pay indicate gaps in the quality and implementation of these policies, which have a direct impact on the ability  of women to gain experience and participate economically in emerging job opportunities in water sector and to advance  to management positions.

The Program includes activities to address key gender gaps in women’s  participation and decision-making roles in both the river chief system and the wastewater utilities. Under Result Area 1, a  provincial level, public engagement manual is proposed to be developed for the River Chief System as an Intermediate  Indicator. This will include provisions to increase gender inclusion and build women’s capacity to engage and serve in  citizen river chief positions, collaborate with women’s organization to provide technical training, mentoring, and study  tours to women RCs and increase women’s capacity and their engagement in local river management decision-making. It  will include provisions for collaborating with women’s organizations to organize public awareness campaigns on the  importance of women’s contributions to river management decision making; document women’s participation in public  decision-making on river management and track the proportion of women as citizen river chiefs in demonstration  counties. Implementation of the Manual is expected to contribute to the Program’s target of increasing the participation  of women from around 11 percent to 30 percent in the demonstration counties (IO5). These provincial level activities are  to be complemented by a basin-level case study to shed further light on the basin-level baseline and drivers of the gender  gap, raise awareness among Government officials within the basin on these gaps, and draw lessons to fine-tune the  program actions to augment female voice and agency in the RCS system. Under Result Area 3, help the wastewater  management utilities in developing and implementing a gender-inclusive workforce plan that includes provisions to  address obstacles in attracting, recruiting, retaining, and advancing women as part of the wastewater management  strategies to be developed by the demonstration counties under the related Disbursement Linked Indicator. These actions  will build on and adapt from international experience on prohibiting recruitment for male-only employees, offering  affordable childcare, family leave for males as well as females, equal training opportunities for female staff, and gender  awareness training for wastewater service staff.

842,"38. Public sector financing is justified by expected positive externalities in line with the Program's focus on public  goods. The Program will generate environmental benefits from reducing water pollution including reduced marine debris,  providing habitat for plant and animal species, and generating global benefits through reduced GHG emissions. Specific  private sector actors do not capture the economic benefits of most Program outcomes, limiting the possibility for private  financing for many activities (that is, benefits are diffuse and public). The Program will develop institutional systems, which  will sustain and scale the activities delivering these benefits beyond the Program’s life, with a focus on increasing  transparency and efficiency in achieving these outcomes relative to a ‘no Program’ scenario. "
843,"39. The PforR will provide value-add by focusing on a subset of activities where the Government wants to enhance  efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of expenditure. The design of the World Bank Program, in the form of a nested  hierarchy of activities (see Section II in the main text), helps align actions of governments across levels (that is, vertically)  and across jurisdictional borders (horizontally) in support of basin-wide and sub-basin wide outcomes, in ways that do not  always occur under traditional programming and governance arrangements. The World Bank's involvement will increase  central and provincial governments’ exposure to international experience and best practices in integrated basin  management, water pollution control, and ecological flows and ensure lessons from recent World Bank-supported  ecological restoration and water pollution control projects are incorporated into the broader Government program for  the Yangtze River Basin. "
844,"40. This economic assessment uses a simple BCA based on benefit transfer, applied at the sub-basin level for Poyang  Lake and Dongting Lake Basins. The assessment implicitly combines activities under Results Area 1, Results Area 2, and  Results Area 3 to value outcomes as a combined water environment quality improvement. Results Area 1 (institutional  strengthening) is seen as facilitating outcomes achieved under Results Area 2 and Results Area 3. The assessment  compares a scenario of no Government program to a scenario of a Government program including World Bank support.  This approach is used because under a PforR, Government and World Bank funds are combined to achieve results, with "
845,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
846,limited distinction at the activity level between World Bank-financed and Government-financed achievements. This  approach can determine whether the overall program – of which Bank financing part-supports – is net socially beneficial. 
847,"41. Expected benefits from the program will accrue at both local and global levels. At the local level, increases in  biodiversity and vegetative cover can be expected, together with a decrease in pollutants in major waterways and thus  periods of eutrophication, which can be expected to improve the amenity value of rivers and lakes, recreation  opportunities, real estate values, fishery productivity, shipping services, tourism, and reduced costs of water treatment.  Global benefits will result from improved biodiversity, such as benefits to internationally migratory birds (Dongting and  Poyang Lake are important migratory bird habitats), reduced coastal eutrophication, and reduced marine plastic debris.  Climate benefits (GHG mitigation) will be mainly derived from reduced eutrophication124 of lakes and waterways caused  by discharges of livestock waste and wastewater. Costs are based on total program funding over 2021–2026, which is  expected to be US$6,526 million, of which an expected US$6,126 million (93.87 percent) will be funded by the Government  and US$400 million (6.13 percent) financed by the proposed IBRD loan (see Section II.C). Of the US$6,126 million  Government funding, it is estimated that US$2,519 million will come from Jiangxi Province and US$3,607 million will come  from Hunan Province. "
848,"42. To estimate the program’s economic benefits, benefit transfer from available environmental valuation research  in China was used. The economic values of water quality and ecological improvement are challenging to quantify due to  the dispersed spatial extent of benefits across the basin, the wide range (and indirect nature) of benefit types, and data  limitations. However, a number of studies provide benefit estimations that can be adapted to the parameters of this  program to indicate likely economic values. These studies utilize the contingent valuation method125 (CVM) to capture the  broad range of benefits (both use and non-use economic values) that are expected. Economic assessment at the lake basin  level considers the benefits from the program as a whole (that is, as a package of activities) within its basin areas, thus  capturing the bulk of provincial-level and county-level activities. The Program’s geographic focus within Jiangxi is Poyang  Lake Basin, which covers 94 percent of the province. The Program’s geographic focus within Hunan is Dongting Lake Basin,  which covers 97 percent of the province. "
849,"43. A survey of relevant literature found four studies well-suited to comprehensively valuing water environment  improvements in river basins (Table 3.8). A lower bound of 0.55 percent and an upper bound of 2.9 percent for WTP as  a percentage of gross household income was found across studies for comprehensive impacts of water pollution, including  water treatment and health values, amenity values, recreational values, and ecological values (existence value to people).  While they are broad, these attributes are similar to those expected from the present program and thus provide rough  indications of the population’s comprehensive valuation (that is, including both use and non-use values) of the outcomes  of the program. The lower identified estimate was used for a conservative approximation (0.55 percent of household  income) of the values Jiangxi and Huanan residents place on improving water quality in these two basins. Adjustment for  these provinces’ population and per capita income levels were made and estimates compared to the total program cost  (Table 3.8).  "
850,"  124 Eutrophication, caused by excessive richness of nutrients, increases the emission of methane, which is more than 25 times as potent as carbon  dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.  125 Contingent valuation method uses questionnaires targeted to impacted populations to elicit their WTP for non-market environmental goods,  such as avoidance or reduction of pollution impacts. It has been applied extensively to water pollution issues. "

864,"45. A quantification of GHG net emissions is made for the PforR Program, focused on DLIs 3.1 and 3.3 (Table 3.11).  Quantification does not include emissions reductions through institutional, policy and planning measures (DLI.1 and DLI.2)  although these are expected to have considerable (but difficult to quantify) emissions mitigation benefits (see para. 47).  Emissions are assessed over 15 years consistent with the economic analysis. "
865,"• DLI 3.1: Improvements to the wastewater network is expected to prevent leakage of around 9,000 kg of COD  annually into primarily groundwater, mitigating methane emissions. Based on the World Bank’s GHG  Accounting Tool for Water Sector Lending Projects, improvements are estimated to result in a net annual  mitigation of 25,705 tons CO2-e. "
866,"• DLI 3.3: treatment and reuse of livestock/poultry manure is expected through increased use of on-farm  treatment facilities and organic fertilizer reuse (substituting for synthetic fertilizer). Manure treatment and  reuse is expected to be 1,048,300 tons (Hunan) and 473,100 tons (Jiangxi) due to Program activities. Based  on the FAO Ex-ACT GHG calculation tool, and with use of a conservative nitrogen fertilizer replacement value  (0.5), improvements are estimated to result in a net annual mitigation of 13,244 CO2-e. "

868,DLI Activity Project gross emissions  Baseline emissions  Net emissions  Net Average Annual Emissions  
869,"46. In total, the program is expected to realize at least 0.58 million tons CO2-e in emissions mitigation over a 15- year period, with an implied value (based on a shadow price of carbon) of US$ 17.9–36.3 million132 over the economic  life of the Program. The calculations are limited to the 10 demonstration counties that are the target of the Bank’s  financing, and for conservativeness does not include scale-up throughout the wider government program supported by  the Program. "
870,"47. Other elements of the Program under DLI.1 and DLI.2 are expected to have substantial GHG mitigation benefits  on top of those calculated here. These are challenging to quantify, and so the quantitative estimates above should be  considered a lower bound on the Program’s overall GHG mitigation. Policies and plans implemented under DLI.2 are  expected to lead to longer-term water quality improvements through reduced nutrient pollution and thus reduced  eutrophication, 133 through their support for nutrient pollution mitigation (the integrated water and environment  management plan for the Gan River). Mitigation is also expected due to implementation of environmental water flows  under DLI.2, due to stabilized water levels that supports aquatic vegetation and mitigates methane emissions.134 DLI.1  supports data platforms that underpin water quality management and pollution control, further contributing to longer- term mitigation benefits (see para. 37 and footnotes 77 and 78 for further detail on climate benefits).  "
871,"  132 The shadow price of carbon represents emissions’ global externality value and is set at US$38 per ton (lower bound) and US$75 per ton (upper  bound) in 2017, increasing by 2.25 percent per year. This calculation represents the net present value (at lower and upper bound prices) of the  quantified emissions mitigation at a 6 percent discount rate, over 15 years consistent with the economic analysis. See World Bank Group (2017).  Shadow Price of Carbon in Economic Analysis (link).  133 Eutrophication causes methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition and has been an issue within the Program’s sub-basins. Notably,  Poyang and Dongting Lakes have experienced instances of eutrophication. More broadly, nutrient pollution may contribute to downstream and  offshore eutrophication in the East China Sea. A recent study calculated the present value of the global social cost of eutrophication-driven  methane emissions from lakes at an annual amount of US$0.21–2.31 trillion (US$ 2015). See Downing, J. A., et al. 2021. “Protecting Local Water  Quality Has Global Benefits.” Nature Communications 12: 2709 (link).  134 Rosentreter, et al. (2021).

873,"1. Program Scope. The PforR will support a subset of activities from the Government’s sub-national provincial  programs for the YREB in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces. The provincial plans represent the Government’s program (in  conjunction with the province’s 14th Five Year Plans) and contain a larger set of activities than the Bank’s Program.  Implementation of the Program will follow the existing national, provincial, and sectoral legal framework and practices for  fulfilling public financial management, public procurement, and governance responsibilities. The FSA provides a  comprehensive review and analysis of the current systems, identifies risks, and recommends mitigation measures for  implementation to enhance the performance of the current systems in meeting the Program objectives. This annex  summarizes the main conclusions of the FSA. "
874,"2. Assessment of Fiduciary Systems. There is no difference between government program and the Program financed  by the Bank regarding geographic boundary. In Jiangxi, the Program covers about 100 counties included in the River Basin  Eco-Compensation Mechanism for the “5-Rivers-1-Lake” Plan; in Hunan, the Program covers about the same number of  counties included in the Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin. The FSA assessed the  public financial management system and the public procurement system of key program implementing agencies and their  line agencies. These agencies include but not limited to, at provincial level, Finance Bureau (FB), Development and Reform  Commission (DRC), Department of Environment and Ecology (DEE), Department of Water Resources (DWR), Department  of Agriculture and Rural Affaires (DARA), and Provincial Audit Office (PAO); and at county level, Water Resource Bureau  (WRB), Housing and Construction Bureau (HCB), Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau (ARAB), of four counties in Hunan  and six counties in Jiangxi.  The assessment covers the review of the PFM cycle, Program systems and capacity  improvements, and the Program implementation support. "
875,"3. The assessment concludes that the Program’s fiduciary systems are adequate for meeting Bank’s PforR Policy and  Directive requirements. The systems can reasonably assure that the Program’s financing proceeds will be used for the  intended purposes, with due attention to the principles of economy, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and  accountability. "
876,"4. Public Financial Management System. The Budget Law of the People's Republic of China (PRC), issued in 2015  and revised in 2018, has set the budget management framework for the central government and local governments at all  levels in China. Jiangxi Province integrated fiscal transfers from the central government, budgetary funds from local  governments and the market, and established Jiangxi’s River Basin Ecological Compensation Fund since 2016 (the Program  the Bank will finance).  The budget quota of compensation fund is distributed to city/county government in two tranches.   The first tranche which mainly comes from central government transfers is distributed in advance at the end of the  previous year, and the second one mainly from provincial government is normally delivered in the second half of the  current year.  The city/county government used to integrate the first tranche in their annual government budget, but the  treatment of the second tranche is various.  Some counties included the second tranche in their annual budget based on  the projection and made adjustment later on, while others just waited the distribution of budget quota.  In Hunan province  a program called “Dongting Lake Water Environment Comprehensive Treatment Program” has been approved by the State  Council with total estimated budget of CNY 59.18 billion covering the period from 2018-2025.  However, program budget  was not prepared, and no clear funding sources were identified for each program activity. Instead, sectoral departments  were required to integrate various available financing sources.  In addition, some of the upper level transferring funds are  distributed to counties in the form of general budget rather than ear-marked budget, and counties are playing essential  roles in deciding how to use the program funds although central and provincial government set up the requirement on  minimized percentage of using transferring funds on program activities.   "
877,"5. Per the county’s self-reporting in 45 counties of Jiangxi province, the average utilization rate of the program funds  was 90.67% in the past three years.  Through analyzing the final accounts in Hunan province for the past three years it is "
878,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
879,"noted that Hunan used about CNY 24.34 billion on water environmental management from the year 2018 to 2020, roughly  matching the total allocated budget, indicating program activities were mostly implemented as planned.  Governments at  all levels have integrated all financial funds into the treasury single account (TSA) system. All revenues are directly  collected into the treasury account or the special financial account, and all expenditures are paid to the  contractors/suppliers/beneficiaries through the TSA.  "
880,"6. Since program is not a budget classification element, it is hard to trace the program expenditures from the existing  Government treasury system. In Hunan Province, the counties receiving program funds are not required to report program  expenditures regularly to upper-level government. In Jiangxi Province, although government decree requires that county  government report to PDRC and PFD about its program expenditures annually, such requirement has not been strictly  implemented always.  As a result, program expenditures are not properly monitored and managed at provincial level.   "
881,"7. There is adequate control over, and stewardship, of program funds, with well-defined delegation of authority.  Following the national policy and regulations issued by the MOF and NDRC, the provincial governments have issued a  series of regulations regarding fund management, implementation measures, and result verification procedures, and so  on.  Based on the interviews on counties visited, it was noted that internal audit function had not been widely established  within county budgetary units, however, the supervision and performance evaluation unit (the unit responsible for the  internal audit) within county finance bureau sometimes carried out its supervision on the usage of compensation funds.  "
882,"8. Although government auditors indeed audit program funds when they carry out budget execution audit,  accountability audit and other types of audits, no specific audit was conducted by provincial audit offices (PAOs) and audit  offices of interviewed counties on the usage of program funds in the past years.  The audit of the proposed Program will  be conducted by the provincial audit offices. Besides conducting the audit on budget execution and other provincial level  entities, the PAOs have been the auditors of World Bank-financed projects in two provinces for about three decades. They  are the auditors the Bank accepted in China. The first year’s audit report issued by the PAOs is subject to the quality review  by the China National Audit Office (CNAO). "
883,"9. Public Procurement System. TBL and GPL are the primary public procurement laws governing public procurement  in China. TBL focuses on construction related works, goods, and consulting services, while GPL focuses on fiscal budget  funds financed purchasing activities carried out by government departments, institutions, and organizations. The  demarcation line is not very clear between the two until the issuance of monetary threshold135 for tendering and bidding  activities by NDRC and guidance documents by the MOF, NDRC, and respective line ministries. Each province and line  ministry issue procurement related guidance and orders to regulate procurement in its respective administrative  jurisdiction or sector. Though fragmented, there’s no conflict with the two laws. Anti-corruption requirements and  measures are available in laws and regulations to prevent, report, detect, investigate, prosecute, and sanction fraud and  corruption conducts. "
884,"10. The assessment analyzed data, interviewed, and discussed in person with procuring entities and public transaction  centers (mandated by government for providing service and supervision to purchasing activities through open and  selective bidding) on procurement legal framework implementation in practice. It identifies no deviations from the legal  requirements.   "
885,"11. The key stakeholders of procurement under the Program are line government agencies, procuring entity,  procurement agent, design institute, supervisor, transaction center and the selected supplier / contractor / consultant.  The line government agencies plan and get approval the activities to be carried out under the Program; the procurement  agent assist the procuring entity (government agency itself or its delegated agencies) to prepare procurement documents  and facilitate the procurement process; design institute provides technical contribution to the procurement process;  supervisor monitors contract implementation; transaction center provides service to procurement process and supervises "
886,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
887,the process simultaneously; the selected supplier / contractor / consultant implements the contract as agreed with the  employer / purchaser / client.  
888,12. A complaint mechanism is provided in both TBL and GPL. Complainant has the right to file a complaint with the  procuring entity or supervising authority of the procuring entity. GPL further allows administrative reconsideration or  administrative proceeding to the People’s court in case the complainant is unsatisfied with the resolution or any delay  handling of the case by the supervising authority of the procuring entity.   
889,"13. Key Conclusions and Recommendations. A comprehensive PFM framework has been established including  government regulations, decrees, standards, and procedures, and so on which regulate the program activities to ensure  program funds are used for the intended purposes.  However, the enforcement is various at different places and the  Bank’s involvement could strengthen the institutional capacity of related government entities.  Given Program is not an  element for budget classification in China, which brings challenges on most PFM areas.  During the fiduciary assessment,  the major financial management risks have been identified and mitigation measures provided: "
890,(a) The financing sources of the program is quite comprehensive as it integrates funds from very broad sources  and some of them are one time compensation funds.  Multiple-year program budgeting should be prepared  to ensure program funds could be secured and county government could prioritize its investment to enhance  the efficiency of its scarce financing resources. 
891,(b) Budget quota was distributed to counties/cities in batches and some program funds were delivered in the  second half year or even the year end which prevents the county government from including the entire  program funds in its annual budget and delays the implementation of planned activities.  Provincial entities  should revisit their budget quota distribution and take actions to ensure the budget quota could be  distributed to county/city in advance. 
892,"(c) ‘Program’ is not a budget classification element in China and the required Program financial reporting can’t  be generated from government treasury system.  A blue tagging mechanism which can trace program  expenditures from government existing integrated financial management system has been recommended  and it is expected to be piloted, especially in those demonstration counties, during project implementation.  This also creates fundamental basis for generating program financial reporting from the Government  treasury system. "
893,(d) No requirement by provincial government on reporting of program expenditures in Hunan province and the  reporting requirement stipulated in government decrees were not strictly implementation in Jiangxi  province. A tailored program financial reporting templet will be designed which can capture the data from  government system and used by the project upon agreed by related government entities. 
894,(e) Absence of efficient supervision by related provincial entities on the usage of program funds may bring  potential risk of improper use of program funds.  The decrees about program expenditure supervision should  be established in Hunan province.  Provincial entities involved should strengthen the supervision on program  funds in line with related government decrees. 
895,(f) Government auditors did not audit the program funds and prepare the program audit report.  The Bank will  work with the Provincial Audit Offices (PAO) to develop the terms of reference (TOR) for program auditing  to ensure program funds could be audited in line with the Bank’s policy.   
896,"14. The Program has a robust legal framework for procurement, which includes the Tendering and Bidding Law of  1999; the Government Procurement law of 2003; and regulations and orders issued at national, provincial, and county  levels. Although the laws could be modernized and aligned to modern principles such as ‘value for money’ and ‘fit for "
897,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
898,"purpose’, both offer a fair playing field for bidders and promote transparency and competitiveness. Four major  procurement risks have been identified and mitigation measures provided: "
899,"(a) Contracts may be awarded to firms or individuals that are debarred or under temporary suspension by the  World Bank or other multilateral development banks. The following mitigation measures are proposed: (i)  upon Program loan effectiveness, the Provincial Program Office shall issue a high-level official letter or official  instruction to require Program implementation agencies (PIAs) to ensure that no contract will be awarded  to ineligible firms or individuals; (ii) procurement staff at the Provincial Program Office are to check the latest  list of debarred and temporarily suspended firms and individuals136 before contract award to ensure that  contract being awarded to eligible firms or individuals only; and (iii) the TOR for the annual external audit  shall include the task of randomly selecting contracts and assessing whether they have been awarded to an  ineligible firm or individual.  "
900,"(b) The World Bank may not be informed of fraud allegations and corruption issues during implementation. A  Program Implementation Plan (PIP) shall therefore require the client to inform the World Bank of any  credible and material allegations of fraud and any corruption issues as part of the Program progress reports,  as mandated in the Loan Agreement.  "
901,"(c) In Jiangxi, the Price Commitment Method is widely used for bid evaluation by using the cost estimate as a  key reference for contract price determination. To avoid substantial deviation between contract price and  the prevailing market price level, the PMO is required to regularly update the cost estimate by taking account  of market variants in a timely manner to ensure realistic value for money is being achieved.   "
902,"(d) Contracts may not be completed within the contractual completion time, and the contract completion audit  may not be completed in a timely manner. Human, financial and policy resources should be allocated by  Hunan and Jiangxi PDRCs for close monitoring contract implementation progress to minimize or avoid  foreseeable cost overruns and/or implementation delays. "
903,Table 4.1. Program Fiduciary Systems Risks and Mitigation Measures  
904,The contracts may be awarded to firms or individuals which are  debarred or under temporary suspension by the World Bank or other  multilateral development banks. 
905,"PAP: (1) The PDRC shall, upon Program loan effectiveness, issue a high- level official letter or official instruction to implementation agencies to  ensure that no contract will be awarded to ineligible firms or  individuals. (2) One of the duties of the procurement staff at the Hunan  and Jiangxi PMO will be to check the latest World Bank lists of the  debarred and temporarily suspended firms and individuals before  contract award to ensure that contracts are awarded to eligible firms or  individuals. (3) The TOR for annual external audit includes the task of  randomly selecting awarded contracts to check whether they have  been awarded to ineligible firms or individuals. "
906,The World Bank may not be informed of any credible and material  allegations of fraud and corruption during the implementation of the  Program. 
907,"PAP: The PPMO shall regularly inform the World Bank of any credible  and material allegations of fraud and corruption in the Program  progress report, as required in the Loan Agreement and the Program  Agreement. "

912,distribution and take actions to ensure the budget quota could be  distributed to the county/city in advance. 
913,‘Program’ is not a budget classification element in China and the  required Program financial reporting cannot be generated from the  Government treasury system. 
914,"PIP: A blue tagging mechanism which can trace Program expenditures  from the Government’s existing integrated FM system has been  recommended and it is expected to be piloted during project  implementation, especially in those demonstration counties. Provincial  finance departments will decide when and how to implement this  piloting by considering the readiness of government reform on the  integrated financial management information system.  "
915,No requirement by provincial government on reporting of program  expenditures in Hunan Province and the reporting requirement  stipulated in government decrees were not strictly implementation  in Jiangxi Province. Absence of efficient supervision by related  provincial entities on the usage of Program funds may bring potential  risk of improper use of program funds. 
916,PIP: Related decrees on Program expenditure supervision should be set  up in Hunan Province. Provincial entities involved should strengthen the  supervision on Program funds in line with related Government decrees.  Guidance and training should be provided on supervision and  performance evaluation unit as they are performing the internal audit  function. 
917,Government auditors did not audit the Program funds and prepared  the Program audit report.  
918,The World Bank will work with the PAOs to develop the TOR for  program auditing to ensure Program funds could be audited in line with  the World Bank’s policy.  
919,"In Jiangxi, the most common procurement method is the Price  Commitment Method. The Price Commitment Method displays the  procurement principles of being open, fair, and transparent but it is  questionable as to whether it offers value for money as the price is  predetermined and bidders can’t offer a lower price.  "
920,"PAP: For value for money to be achieved, it is critical that the cost  estimating process is robust and that unit prices are regularly updated  to ensure the cost estimate is as accurate as possible. "
921,"Based on the analyses of the contract administration, most contracts  were completed within the contractual period. However, 55 out of  272 contracts (20.2 percent) in Hunan and 58 out of 254 contracts  (22.8 percent) in Jiangxi could not be completed within the  contractual completion time; the longest delay was one year. Some  contract completion audit could not be conducted on time. "
922,PIP: Procedures or a guidance note should be produced by Hunan and  Jiangxi PDRCs that clearly define the undertaking of contract  administration responsibilities in line with the domestic regulatory  framework. 
923,15. Program Implementation Support. Proposed fiduciary implementation support includes the following: 
924,"• Review Program implementation progress, including achievement of Program results and PAP implementation. "

935,"  1. The Program will support improvement in water and ecological quality in river and lake basins in Jiangxi and Hunan  and is thus expected to bring overall E&S benefits. The implementation of activities under the Program will rely on the  existing national and provincial legal framework and institutional system for managing E&S issues. The ESSA provides a  comprehensive review of relevant E&S risk systems and procedures and tracking of performance in China nationally, and  in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, and recommends necessary actions to address the identified gaps as well as opportunities  to enhance E&S performance during implementation. This annex summarizes the main conclusions of ESSA. "
936,"2. Potential Environmental and Social Effects. An E&S risk screening was conducted for the Program-supported  activities, during ESSA preparation, and concluded that the overall E&S risk rating of this Program is Substantial. "
937,"3. The Program will support pollution control and ecological restoration activities including construction and  upgrading of county and township wastewater treatment plants and pipelines, agricultural plastics collection and recycle,  waste treatment of existing livestock farms, and institutional and capacity-building activities. These activities will generate  E&S benefits of reduced pollutant discharge to water bodies and improved river and lake water quality and basin ecological  environment. Activities with the potential to cause significant adverse impacts on the environment and/or people are  excluded, including activities that (a) involve closure or relocation of livestock, poultry, or aquaculture farming; (b) involve  large-scale infrastructure construction; (c) have substantial impacts on river hydrology and ecology; and (d) involve the  allocation or conveyance of water, including inter-basin water transfers or other activities, resulting in significant changes  to water quality or availability. The ESSA has formulated an E&S exclusion list.  "
938,"4. The main adverse E&S impacts include construction-related impacts such as dust, noise, disturbance of water  body, soil erosion, wastewater and solid waste management, construction worker and community’s health and safety,  labor management, small scale of land acquisition, temporary land use, and potential impacts to vulnerable groups;  impacts during operation such as effluent discharge from wastewater treatment facilities, safe operation of facilities,  workers’ health and safety, safe application of fertilizers, and impacts on farmers’ livelihood; and also the potential  downstream indirect impacts of TA activities. These adverse E&S impacts are not significant and can be well identified and  readily avoided, minimized, and mitigated through mature technologies and good management practices. Neither OP/BP  7.50 International Waterways nor OP/BP 7.60 Disputed Areas are applicable to the Program. "
939,"5. Assessment of Environmental and Social Management System. A comprehensive review of the legal and  regulatory framework for E&S management relevant to the activities supported under the PforR was conducted, including  institutional arrangements, management procedures and their implementation, institutional capacity, and performance. "
940,"6. Overall, China has established a comprehensive system for the management of E&S issues at both national and  provincial levels (including Jiangxi and Hunan provinces), which consists of laws, regulations, guidelines, specifications,  and standards principally consistent with the World Bank’s PforR Policy and Directive. This system provides a reasonable  basis for addressing the E&S issues related to activities supported under the PforR. "
941,"7. Environmental Management System. Since the promulgation of its first Environmental Protection Law in 1979,  China has gradually established a comprehensive environmental management legal framework, becoming one of the  region’s most dynamic environmental law frameworks. In recent years, the Government of China has worked to reform  its environmental management system by enhancing its law enforcement and prevention approach. A set of laws,  regulations, and technical guidelines have been—or are in the process of being—issued or updated by national and local  governments regarding EIA for construction projects and OHS management. "
942,"8. The key PforR government stakeholders involved in environmental, health, and safety management include  various levels of ecology and environment bureau (EEB), health commission, emergency management bureau,  construction bureau, water resource bureau, and agriculture and rural affairs bureau. The EEB is responsible for reviewing "
943,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
944,"and approving the EIA documents and supervising the environmental compliance of activities under this PforR during the  construction and operation phases; the water resource bureau reviews and approves the projects’ water and soil  conservation reports; the emergency management bureau and health commission take overall responsibility of OHS  management; the construction bureau has sector management authority for wastewater and solid waste projects; and  the agriculture and rural affairs bureau supervises the activities involving fertilizer, agricultural plastics, and livestock  waste. "
945,"9. Consultations of government departments at provincial, county, township, and village levels and site visits to  typical projects in selected counties of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, have demonstrated that the domestic environmental  management systems, implementation mechanisms, and institutional arrangements related to the Program activities are  principally consistent with the World Bank’s PforR Policy and Directive and can provide a generally effective management  framework for the implementation of the Program activities. The assessment results also indicate inadequacies in the  implementation of some environmental management systems, mainly including weak environmental protection and  participation awareness of farmers in chemical fertilizer reduction and agricultural plastics recycling, and inadequate OHS  training for contracted and temporary workers involved in the waste collection activities. "
946,"10. Social Management System. The assessment concludes that China has formulated a series of laws and policies at  the national and local levels and has established appropriate management agencies and mechanisms to govern social risks  in relation to the Program's activities. Subject to the potential social impacts and risks identified, the social system  assessment focused on the dimensions concerning social impacts and risks assessment and management system, cultural  heritage protection, occupational health and community safety, land acquisition and resettlement, public participation,  ethnic minorities, and vulnerable groups. The social systems are deemed comprehensive and consistent with the World  Bank PforR Policy and Directive. "
947,"11. Jiangxi and Hunan have established management agencies with clear responsibilities and qualified staff at the  provincial, municipal, and county levels for managing corresponding social risks and impacts. The ESSA report assessed  the organizational setup of relevant social authorities against the principles and elements as set out in the World Bank  Guidance. For example, China has established a functioning mechanism of Social Stability Risk Assessment, which is  implemented by related project implementation agencies and managed through the committees of provincial and county  political and legislative affairs of related regional governments. The cultural departments are responsible for managing  adverse impacts on physical cultural heritage. The natural resource bureaus enforce land acquisition, compensation, and  resettlement with the support of and coordination by township governments and village committees. Other line bureaus,  such as social security bureaus, labor bureaus, among others, are also to be involved in the process of livelihood  restoration for project-affected persons. China has set up various competent authorities to manage to support and  assistance to different vulnerable groups. For example, poverty reduction offices or countryside revitalization bureaus are  mainly responsible for poverty reduction, disabled person federation for assistance to disabled people, civil affairs bureaus  for support to left-behind old people and children, and women’s federations for assistance to women. "
948,"12. During the preparation, the engagement with various stakeholders from both provincial and county levels, and  the solid due diligence of relevant prior similar projects, concluded that the social management systems are well  functioning in line with the regulations and that the overall social outcomes in similar domestic projects are fairly good.  However, the assessment also identified some minor gaps for further improvement to enhance social impacts, including  (a) strengthening the recording and documentation for the processes of social risk screening, public consultation and  information disclosure process, and grievance redress mechanism (GRM) operation; (b) extending the physical and  occupational health examinations to contract workers or/and temporary workers; and (c) establishing monitoring  mechanism for social risk management of World Bank-financed activities. "
949,"13. Consultation and Information Disclosure. Despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the team explored  various means (both face-to-face and virtual) to meaningfully engage with relevant stakeholders, following the World "
950,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
951,"Bank’s latest guidance notes137 on public consultation in response to the outbreak. Relevant stakeholders, including line  government departments, enterprise representatives, the workers, and local communities, were consulted in the process  through meetings and field visits to selected counties. The draft ESSA report was shared with Jiangxi and Hunan PPMO  and selected counties (six counties of Dayu, Chongyi, Yugan, Yongfeng, Fuliang, and Yudu in Jiangxi and four counties of  Shimen, Ziyang, Miluo, and Yuanling in Hunan) and consultation workshops were carried out with the key stakeholders at  provincial and county levels. The participants voiced their support in implementing the proposed Program and concurred  with the findings and recommendations of the draft ESSA, which were considered relevant and valuable for strengthening  the actual effectiveness of the implementation of the existing E&S system. Some participants provided valuable opinions  to improve the accuracy of the ESSA description in local context, which have been reflected in the revised ESSA. The draft  ESSA has been disclosed on the World Bank’s website on November 1, 2021, on the provincial website in Jiangxi on October  27, 2021 and Hunan on November 04, 2021. "
952,"14. Key Conclusions and Recommendations. The assessment concluded that although the national and provincial  system for addressing E&S impacts is principally consistent with the World Bank’s PforR Policy and Directive, opportunities  do exist for strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of E&S risk management under the Program. The key  recommendations are as follows: "
953,"(a) Provide training on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste management to farmers. The provincial  (and county) agriculture and rural affairs bureau should develop relevant training programs, prepare training  materials, and conduct trainings during Program implementation. Meanwhile, subsidy and incentive  mechanisms are suggested, where appropriate. "
954,"(b) Hunan provincial (and county) agriculture and rural affairs bureau should establish a sustainable incentive  mechanism to increase the collection rate of agricultural plastics, in which the existing jobholders should be  appropriately considered, for example, the village cleaners. "
955,"(c) Enhance the OHS management of the enterprises involved in the Program activities. For jobs with potential  occupational hazards, take such measures as occupational hazard identification and pre-job, on-the-job, and  post-job health checkup. Strengthen OHS training for contracted and temporary workers (including  emergency response and proper use of personal protective equipment). "
956,"(d) Establish a social impacts and risks screening, public participation, monitoring, and reporting mechanism.  The PIAs shall monitor and record the implementation of social impacts and risks (including land acquisition  and resettlement impacts, support for vulnerable groups, and so on) screening, mitigation measures  implementation, information disclosure, public participation, and GRM. Disclose to the public the hotlines  and contacts of GRM and establish an effective external communication mechanism. "
957,"15. To implement these recommendations, three actions are included in the PAP. "
958,(a) Provincial and county agriculture and rural affairs bureaus shall provide trainings on chemical fertilizer use  and agricultural waste management to farmers. 
959,"(b) The PIAs shall strengthen OHS training and regular health checkups for all in-service workers, including  temporary workers. "
960,"(c) The PIAs shall establish a social impacts and risks screening, public participation, monitoring, and reporting  mechanism and strengthen information and record management in social risk management. "

982,"  1. The Program includes an IPF to support basin-level activities that contribute to the national program for the  YREB. The supported activities will promote cross-sectoral coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation toward  improved water quality and ecological protection in the Yangtze River Basin. The central component contributes to the  Program’s nested hierarchy of activities by supporting implementation of the national YREB program at the basin level,  while further facilitating the implementation of the sub-national YREB programs at provincial, sub-basin, and local levels.  This annex describes the central component motivation, connection to the provincial Program components, activities,  financing, fiduciary, environmental, and social considerations. "
983,"2. A Program Steering Committee (PSC) will be led by the Office of the Leading Group for the Development of the  Yangtze River Economic Belt under NDRC (YREB Coordination Office). The YREB Coordination Office works in  coordination with other NDRC departments, notably Rural Economy, Environment and Natural Resources, and Regional  Revitalization to promote implementation of the national YREB strategy through policy formulation and high-level  planning.138 The PSC will be headed by a senior official of the NDRC YREB Coordination Office and comprise representatives  from the MOF, MWR, MEE, MHURD, and MARA, among others, along with representatives from the participating  provinces. The PSC will be responsible for providing overall coordination and guidance. It will be supported by a CPMO  and an expert advisory panel that will provide technical support and expert advice to the PSC. "
984,"3. The Central Program Management Office (CPMO) will be hosted by the Changjiang (Yangtze) Water Resources  Commission (CWRC). The CWRC is a river basin authority under the MWR, with a mandate to undertake integrated water  resources management (including water conservation and allocation), basin planning, water infrastructure construction,  and scientific and policy research. The CPMO will be responsible for coordination, reporting, management, including  management of E&S social aspects, and M&E of the activities under the Central Basin IPF, the provision of capacity  building, support to the PSC, along with Program implementation support, including consolidated Program reporting. The  CWRC will host the CPMO given its alignment between its mandate and the Program objectives, plus technical capacity,  to ensure an integrated river basin approach. The CPMO may also select public institutes under the CWRC to carry selected  activities under the Basin IPF using eligibility criteria set forth in the Project Operations Manual.139 "
985,"  138 While the NDRC YREB Coordination Office is responsible for the national YREB strategy, a separate policy division of NDRC is responsible for the  Yangtze Law specifically (with implementation of the law the responsibility of various implementing agencies and provinces).  139 The selected executing agencies will be required to establish a Management Office, headed by a qualified officer and supported by adequate  staff, to manage all activities until completion. The CWRC will sign an implementation agreement with each of the selected executing agencies to  define the roles and responsibilities in implementation of each of the tasks, as well as eligible costs. The engagement of public institutes  established practice in World Bank-financed projects in China, including in the GEF Mainstreaming Integrated Water and Environment  Management Project (P145897), Economic Transformation and Institutional Capacity Building Project (P144270), Building a Modern Fiscal System  Technical Assistance Project (P154694), Yunnan Highway Asset Management Project (P132621), and Guangdong Compulsory Education Project  (P154621). "
986,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
987,"4. Activities supported by the Central Basin IPF are motivated by the objectives, roles, and responsibilities outlined  in the Yangtze River Protection Law. The law represents a key legislative step toward advancing implementation of the  national YREB program. It defines high-level obligations on central, basin, provincial, and county governance including (a)  basin-level coordination mechanisms; (b) standards, technical guidelines, and strategies for management of resource  protection, ecosystem restoration and protection of biodiversity, along with pollution control; (c) provincial institutional  strengthening, policy, and strategic planning; (d) sub-basin-level TA and innovations for integrated water environment  management; and (e) county-level activities focused on reducing pollution loads, including plastics. The central  component activities support the central government's implementation of the law across these areas (described in the  following paragraphs), and further support provinces in implementation of the law in their areas of responsibility also  through links to the provincial sub-programs. "
988,5. Basin-level activities under the central component will support forward-looking policy directions provisioned  under the national YREB program. These are aligned with the roles and responsibilities outlined in the Yangtze River  Protection Law. Activities are arranged into five sub-components: 
989,"• Sub-component 1 - Operationalization of the basin-level river chief system collaboration mechanism. The  objective of this sub-component is to promote development of basin-level coordination mechanisms. River  chiefs play a key role in water quality and ecological protection, as recognized by the Yangtze River Protection  Law. The sub-component will support establishment of a basin-level RCS collaboration mechanism (a forum  for decision-making, coordination, and learning) within the CWRC to promote the coordination of river  protection and restoration activities by river chiefs, and the establishment of a basin-level information  sharing platform, envisaged to be linked to the existing national-level platform and provincial-level  platforms. The working rules for the collaboration mechanism were drafted in 2021 with World Bank "
990,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
991,financing.140 Basin-wide data sharing and a collaboration mechanism aim to increase the alignment of river  chief activities with basin-wide priorities.  
992,"• Sub-component 2 - Research on ecological protection and restoration of lakes and tributary systems. The  objective of this sub-component is to provide research inputs for policies and technical guidelines for  freshwater ecosystem restoration and protection. As stipulated by the Yangtze River Protection Law, basin- level guidelines are required at the basin level for river health and ecological flow. This research will provide  guidance in implementing river health and ecological flow under the law. This sub-component will support  research on freshwater ecosystems and river health using field surveys and desktop reviews to inform the  guidelines. It will support the following activities:  "
993,"(a) Research for river health guidelines. This activity will inform the evaluation of riverine ecology  conditions, including physical, chemical, and biological parameters, that define a composite index. This  index can be used to inform a desired future state (including climate change considerations) and  provides a foundation for identification of actions toward that state. The activity outputs will include  technical guidelines for the assessment of aquatic ecosystems, focusing on the Dongting Lake, Poyang  Lake Basins and tributaries to the Yangtze River. "
994,"(b) Research for systemic protection and restoration of representative aquatic ecosystems. This activity  focuses on Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, which are target sub-basins within the Program's provincial  components, along with important tributaries such as Jialing River, Wujiang River, and Chishui River.  The activity will propose mechanisms for coordinating protection and restoration efforts for the lakes,  drawing on field surveys, desktop reviews, and domestic and international knowledge and best  practices analysis. Research outputs can inform future scaled-up mechanisms across the basin.  "
995,"• Sub-component 3 - investigation and tracing of water pollution sources. The objective of this sub- component is to provide research inputs for management strategies and technical guidelines for persistent  pollutants in the Yangtze River Basin. This includes research on phosphorus sources and flows, which will  support a total phosphorous management framework for the Yangtze River Basin, coordinated emergency  response mechanisms and a set of technological solutions for the Yangtze River Basin, as required by the  Yangtze River Protection Law and the provincial 14 FYPs. Total phosphorus is becoming the primary pollution  indicator that still exceeds regulated standards in the Yangtze River. Research will include review of  international best practices, identification of major sources and hotspots, analysis of total phosphorus  pollution behavior under extreme climate impacts (elevated precipitation and runoff) and propose climate- sensitive policy options to address total phosphorus pollution in targeted sub-basins and across the Yangtze  River Basin. "
996,"• Sub-component 4 - Research on ‘value realization mechanisms’ (ecological incentives). The objective of  this sub-component is to develop innovative incentive mechanisms for ecosystem protection. This activity  will investigate the economic value of ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Basin; determine methods for  integrating ecological data into existing statistical accounts; and design eco-compensation mechanisms and  pollution fee standards for water quality, quantity, and ecological assets. The activity will address current  difficulties in measurement, trading, liquidity, and property rights definition in eco-compensation and  trading programs. "
997,"  140 The Economic Transformation and Institutional Capacity Building Project (P144270) provided financing for TA on a range of priority reform  areas, including river basin management. "
998,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
999,• Sub-component 5 - capacity building and program implementation support. The objective of this sub- component is to promote data sharing and technical capacity and support program implementation. Specific  activities are as follows: 
1000,"(a) Capacity-building trainings and knowledge exchanges. This activity will help strengthen technical  capacity in sub-national institutions for river basin water environment management, including  implementation of the technical guidelines and standards informed by research undertaken in sub- components 2–4. It will also include knowledge exchanges for the study of basin coordination  mechanisms internationally. "
1001,"(b) Program implementation support. This activity will support overall Program activities, including  facilitating and/or undertaking all planned Basin IPF activities, support for the operation of the Program  Steering Committee, and Program implementation support, including consolidated Program reporting.  "
1002,"6. The cost table for the Central Basin IPF prepared by NDRC/CWRC has been reviewed by MoF who have confirmed  up to CNY 48 million equivalent to be financed through the IBRD loan as part of the YRPERP. However, the actual amount  during implementation will be based on the annual workplans agreed with the World Bank, and further reviewed through  internal government budget processes. "
1003,"7. The Central Basin IPF component focuses on Type II TA activities and would have broad E&S benefits. The Central  Basin IPF aims at promoting cross-sectoral coordination and inter-jurisdictional cooperation toward the common goals of  improving water quality and ecological protection in the Yangtze River Basin. The Program’s Central Basin IPF primarily  consists of TA activities with regard to Yangtze River Basin water and environmental protection, including investigation  and traceability of water pollution, inter-correlation of water ecosystems, case studies of systematic environmental  protection and restoration, ecological protection incentive programs, and related capacity-building and international  knowledge exchange activities. "
1004,"8. The Central Basin IPF could have substantial downstream environmental risks and impacts. The Central Basin IPF  is not anticipated to support any physical activities, directly draft policies or regulations, or support feasibility  studies/technical designs for future investment projects. Therefore, implementation of this central component is not likely  to cause any direct adverse environmental impacts but may involve significant stakeholder engagement and public  consultation. The Central Basin IPF potentially has indirect impacts related to the implementation of the products or  outcomes of the TA activities. For example, there could be construction/operation nuisance and community health and  safety risks from civil works of physical investment projects following the TA recommendations, such as wastewater and  solid waste collection and treatment facilities, sampling and monitoring stations, ecological remediation and river/lake  connection works, and so on. Studies aiming to reduce pollutants (for example, phosphorus and plastic waste) released in  the river basin may have downstream implications on resource efficiency and pollution management, such as  relocation/shutting down/upgrading of industrial enterprises; reduced use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides;  agricultural and industrial water efficiency improvement; and control and disposal of hazardous chemicals, agricultural  wastes, and plastic wastes. The studies will also need to consider and assess potential impacts on aquatic life, water rights,  water uses, ecosystem services and broader implications from the perspectives of hydrology, climate change,  sedimentation, urbanization, and industrialization. Meanwhile, there could be a risk of communicable disease  transmission caused by people gathering for trainings, workshops, meetings, and so on, particularly given the context of  the COVID-19 pandemic. "
1005,"9. The Central Basin IPF could have substantial downstream social risks and impacts. Implementing the Central Basin  IPF itself would have moderate social risks, mainly related to health and safety for field workers and meaningful "
1006,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
1007,"stakeholder engagement. However, adopting and enforcing the study outputs could have potentially significant  downstream social changes among relevant communities; enterprises; institutions; and vulnerable groups (such as ethnic  minorities, the workers, farmers, and so on) through regulating land and resources use and constructing and operating  physical facilities to improve water quality and improve ecological environment, and so on. The ESMF identified the  potential downstream social risks, including labor risks, community health and safety, restriction on land use,  resettlement, and exclusion risks for vulnerable groups. Exclusion risks would potentially relate to livelihood impact to  farmers by limiting land use and inadequate consultations with ethnic minorities, and livelihood impacts to workers  potentially experiencing layoff, among others.  "
1008,"10. An ESMF and an SEF have been prepared for the Central Basin IPF consistent with the ESF. The ESMF screened the  potential E&S risks and established the principles, procedures, and requirements for managing the underlying E&S risks  and impacts of the TA activities. The SEF differentiated the roles and responsibilities for CPMO and TA implementing  agencies regarding effective stakeholder engagement throughout the process of TA studies. Both the ESMF and SEF  provide operational guidance for applying relevant ESSs to TA activities and creating added value for enhancing the  operationality of policy recommendations while incorporating solid considerations on significant E&S risks.  "
1009,"11. The material actions have been agreed with the borrower and committed in the ESCP. The ESCP commits the  CPMO, the expert advisory panel, and the TA implementing agencies (that is, Executing Agencies and any additional  contractors for TA activities) to ensure adequate assistance is mobilized from E&S experts. The TORs for TA activities,  subject to the World Bank’s prior review, shall require TA implementing agencies to have E&S specialists’ input on E&S  analysis consistent with relevant ESS, and also carry out meaningful stakeholder engagement throughout the TA activities.  Before initiating a TA activity, the implementing agency shall formulate a specific stakeholder engagement plan (SEP). The  CPMO shall ensure that the TA implementing agencies shall carry out a focused E&S assessment to assess the potential  downstream risks, and the policy recommendations shall include appropriate recommendations consistent with ESF  requirements. Both the CPMO and TA implementing agencies shall enable ongoing meaningful consultation with  representative stakeholders overall the full cycle of TA studies. The CPMO will monitor the E&S performance of the Central  Basin IPF and report to the World Bank on a semiannual basis. "
1010,"12. Information disclosure and public consultation. During preparation, the CWRC, on behalf of the NDRC YREB  Coordination Office, conducted preliminary stakeholder engagement and consultation to inform the preparation of E&S  documents. The draft documents (including ESMF, ESCP, and SEF) were disclosed locally on July 25, 2021.141 The E&S  documents have captured advice and comments received from stakeholders. The final E&S documents have been  disclosed on the World Bank’s website in October 2021 and were redisclosed on the local website on November 08, 2021. "
1011,"13. Institutional arrangements. The CPMO established within the CWRC is responsible for the overall financial  management of the central component. Although the CWRC has even been implementing a World Bank-financed project,  none of the current CWRC staff has such experience. Per review of the CVs of the financial staff assigned, it is noted that  they are qualified to take project FM-related responsibilities.  The financial staff are required to take the self-learning on  the E-learning platform developed by the World Bank and pass the test before the signing of loan agreement.  "
1012,"14. Since it is hard to define the scope of government investment and collect the required financial data, it is agreed  that the Central Basin IPF will be solely financed by IBRD loan and no counterpart funds will be accounted and reported. "
1013,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
1014,The loan agreement will be signed between IBRD and the People’s Republic of China through its MOF. The MOF will be  responsible for the repayment. 
1015,"15. Disbursement arrangements. The borrower has decided that disbursements will be documented via the  transaction-based disbursement method. The primary World Bank disbursement method will be advances to the DA. One  DA in Chinese yuan will be opened and managed by the CWRC. Withdrawal applications (WAs) will be prepared by PMO  to request World Bank disbursements and to document the use of World Bank financing. WAs will include supporting  documents in the form of Statement of Expenditures and source documents identified in the Disbursement and Financial  Information Letter issued by the World Bank. Direct payment and reimbursement from the loan account may also be used,  provided the WA value is above the minimum application amount.  "
1016,"16. The World Bank loan for the IPF component would disburse against 100 percent of eligible expenditures (taxes  inclusive), consisting of goods, consulting services, non-consulting services, training and workshop, and incremental  operating costs. Retroactive financing not to exceed US$1.5 million will be allowed for payments made prior to the date  of the Loan Agreement for the Project, but on or after August 1, 2021 as specified in Loan Agreement, for eligible  expenditures under the Central Basin IPF. "
1017,17. Budgeting. The CWRC will prepare annual loan utilization plan and submit to MOF for approval by the end of  November each year. The approved annual plan will be submitted to the World Bank as well.  Budget variance analysis  will be conducted on semiannual basis by the CWRC and necessary actions will be taken to ensure that the project could  be implemented as planned.  
1018,"18. Funds flow. The World Bank loan proceeds will flow from the World Bank into project DA to be set up at and  managed by the CWRC. The CWRC will be directly responsible for the management, maintenance, and reconciliation of  the DA activities. To ensure proper usage of project funds, payment requests will be prepared by CPMO and reviewed by  related divisions of the CWRC by following its internal procedures (the procedures have been documented in project  financial management manual). The World Bank loan proceeds will be disbursed to the DA and then to contractors or paid  directly to contractors based on the WA instructions. "
1019,"19. Accounting and financial reporting. A centralized project financial management mechanism would be adopted in  the project, that is, all project disbursement- and financial management-related tasks would be handled by the PMO within  the CWRC. The Circular No. 13: ‘Accounting Regulations for the Bank-financed Projects’ issued by the MOF will be adopted  in the project. PMO will be managing, monitoring, and maintaining its project accounting records for the activities they  execute. Original supporting documents will be retained by PMO. The unaudited semiannual project interim financial  reports (format and content in accordance with the abovementioned Circular No.13 agreed with the MOF) will be  prepared and furnished to the World Bank by PMO no later than 60 days following each semester, in form and substance  satisfactory to the World Bank. "
1020,"20. Internal control. The internal control system comprises (a) primary FM responsibilities of the PMO that will be,  but not limited to, reviewing expenditure reporting and financial reports. PMO will be responsible for day-to-day FM work  and submitting project financial reports to the World Bank in compliance with legal documents; (b) the CWRC will oversee  the project DA and the using of the World Bank loan for its intended purpose; (c) appropriate FM duty segregation in the  PMO; and (d) annual external audit to evaluate the performance of the overall internal control system.  A set of sound  internal control procedures have been established in the CWRC and the project will fully rely on its existing internal control  system.  All internal control procedures have been documented in project financial management manual prepared by the  CWRC. "
1021,"21. Audit arrangements. The foreign funds audit center within CNAO has been assigned by CNAO as auditor for the  project. The annual audit report will be issued by the foreign funds audit center, who have extensive experience with  previous World Bank projects and is deemed acceptable to the World Bank. In addition, according to CNAO’s quality "
1022,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
1023,"assurance procedures, each first year’s audit report issued by the audit center should be reviewed by CNAO before the  audit report is submitted to the World Bank. The CPMO will be responsible for submitting the annual audit report of the  project financial statements to the World Bank within six months after the end of each calendar year (June 30). According  to the agreement reached with the MOF and CNAO, the audit report and audited financial statements will be made publicly  available in both World Bank and CNAO’s official websites. This requirement is stipulated in the Loan Agreement.  "
1024,"22. Applicable procurement rules and procedures. Procurement for the central IPF component will be carried out in  accordance with the ‘World Bank Procurement Regulations for IPF Borrowers’, dated November 2020 (hereafter referred  to as the World Bank Procurement Regulations), as required by the provisions of the Legal Agreement. In addition, the  World Bank’s Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA  Credits and Grants, dated October 2006, and thereafter revised in January 2011 and July 2016, will be applicable. The  World Bank’s Systematic Tracking of Exchanges in Procurement (STEP) tool will be used to prepare, clear, and update PPs  and record all procurement transactions.  "
1025,"23. Institutional arrangements for procurement. A CWRC team functioning as the CPMO will play the procurement  role under the Basin IPF. The current proposal is a team of five to six members with one team head and four to five team  members responsible for respective project management functions. The assessment found the appointed procurement  staff has relevant domestic and limited World Bank-financed project procurement experience (one contract). Working  closely with the CWRC are various public entities that could be selected as executing agencies, in accordance with eligibility  criteria acceptable to the World Bank, for implementing activities covering their respective mandates following  government policies and arrangements. An implementation agreement will be signed between CPMO and each EA to  govern the roles and responsibilities of each side. The remaining activities under the project (apart from activities to be  carried out by selected executing agencies), and any contract-based procurement carried out by a selected EA (apart from  incremental cost financed activities) will follow the World Bank Procurement Regulations (November 2020) for selection  of the most appropriate consultant(s) / supplier(s) / contractor(s) to carry out the assignment(s). A project office will be  set up inside each selected executing agency staffed with individuals as focal points for their respective functions. At the  time of assessment, procurement staff at executing agency level had not been appointed yet. Given that no procurement  is expected at the executing agency level during the initial period of the project, a procurement assessment may be carried  out before procurement is initiated at each executing agency, if necessary.  "
1026,"24. Procurement Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures. Based on the World Bank’s assessment, there are two  key procurement risks. The first is the lack of knowledge and experience of carrying out procurement following the World  Bank’s Procurement Regulations, and the second is the possibility of hiring CWRC affiliated agencies on a single source  basis without justifications acceptable to the World Bank. To mitigate the above risks, the following mitigation measures  are proposed and agreed with CPMO: (a) procurement staff will need to participate World Bank procurement online  training through the online training platform142 to get acquainted with the World Bank’s procurement requirements; (b)  procurement staff will receive hands-on training on STEP system; (c) the procurement section of the project operation  manual states procurement roles and responsibilities of CPMO and executing agencies, internal procedures and controls;  (d) advise affiliated agencies who expressed interest to CWRC assignment under the project of their ineligibility to  participate in advance; (e) wider circulation of procurement notices to non-affiliated agencies to engender their interest;  and (f) report to the World Bank any potential or actual conflict of interest or eligibility issues to see what solutions may  be provided.  "
1027,"25. Major procurement envisaged under the project. The Basin IPF would finance TA, goods and non-consulting  services, and incremental operating expenses. Major activities under the Central Basin IPF focuses on five aspects: (a) "
1028,   The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
1029,coordination mechanisms; (b) policy support for ecological protection and environmental restoration; (c) policy and  technical support for water pollution; (d) policy support for ecological incentive mechanisms; (e) capacity building and  program support.  
1030,"26. Quality- and Cost-Based Selection, Quality-Based Selection, Selection Based on the Consultants’ Qualifications,  and Direct Selection methods will be adopted for most of the consulting services contract. State owned research  institutions, colleges, associations, and consulting companies may be eligible to participate only if they meet the Bank’s  eligibility and conflict of interest requirements as stated in the Regulations.  Request for Bids and Request for Quotations  may be more suitable for the procurement of goods and non-consulting services contracts depending on the contract cost  estimate. Direct Selection will be adopted if and when fully justified.  "
1031,"27. Project Procurement Strategy for Development (PPSD) and Procurement Plan (PP). Based on paragraphs 4.1– 4.5 of the World Bank’s Procurement Regulations, a PPSD and an accompanying project PP have been prepared by the  CPMO in close consultation with the World Bank. The PPSD states how procurement activities will help the project achieve  its development objective and deliver best value for money using the fit-for-purpose procurement and risk-managed  approach, giving due consideration to specific project needs and to the country’s operational and market context.  Decisions on the selection methods and market approaches to be adopted in the project PP are justified in the PPSD. This  information will be made available in the project’s database, on the World Bank’s external website, and at the project  implementing agency’s office. The PP will be updated in a way that reflects actual implementation needs and institutional  capacity and will be agreed upon by the World Bank through STEP. The PPSD may need to be updated during project  implementation.  "
1032,"28. Use of STEP. It is mandatory that all procurement transactions for post- and prior-review contracts under the  project be recorded in and processed through STEP, the World Bank’s planning and tracking system. This ensures  comprehensive information on procurement and implementation of all contracts for goods, non-consulting services, and  consulting services awarded under the whole component will automatically be made available. This tool will be used to  manage the exchange of information (such as procurement documents, bid evaluation reports, no objections, contracts,  and so on) between implementing agencies and the World Bank. The World Bank team will provide training to the  borrower on how to establish its account and use the STEP tool. "
1033,"29. Procurement methods and World Bank oversight. The thresholds of individual procurement methods and the  requirements for the World Bank’s prior review are shown in the PP. These will need to be followed for project  procurement activities, which will be agreed upon based on specific World Bank procurement requirements and the  justifications provided in the PPSD. Specific procurement requirements will be included in the project PP; however, any  changes to the needed procurement thresholds during project implementation will have to be justified in the updated  PPSD and reflected in the updated PP. In addition to prior review, supervision carried out from the World Bank offices,  World Bank procurement supervision missions will visit the field at least once a year to carry out procurement supervision  or post-review of procurement activities. The post-review sampling ratio of contracts will be 1:10. "
1034,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program (P171644) 
1035,"  1. Support for implementation of the PforR will require close attention and continuous support from the World Bank  team. The PforR instrument is new to some government teams involved in the Program. This annex outlines the key  activities to address risks identified by the risk assessment and provides the TA needed to improve the quality of Program  implementation. Emphasis is placed on (a) supporting early-stage implementation and building institutional capacity; (b)  reviewing implementation progress (including that of the PAP) and achievement of Program results and DLIs; (c) providing  support to resolve emerging implementation issues; (d) monitoring the adequacy of systems performance, and monitoring  compliance with Legal Agreements; and (e) supporting the Government in monitoring changes in risks.  "
1036,"2. The strategy and approach for implementation support includes an emphasis on the technical, fiduciary, and E&S  support needed during implementation. The World Bank team provided technical expertise during preparation and will  continue to provide technical support during implementation, as well as guidance to the agencies on Fiduciary and E&S  aspects to ensure completion of the actions agreed in the PAP. Implementation support from the procurement and  financial management team will focus on reviewing and monitoring compliance with the Government’s own systems and  the actions defined in the PAP, while the implementation support will also provide TA to address shortcomings identified  during the assessment, most notably around audits and the reporting expenditures. "
1037,"3. Given the multi-provincial, cross-sectoral characteristics of the Program significant resources above the regional  norms will be needed during implementation. The integration of the PforR and the IPF also requires expertise and  assistance with both instruments during implementation. This support will be ensured through leadership and close  contributions from team members in the China Country Office, located in Beijing, with additional support and leadership  from international technical specialists. This combination will leverage the World Bank’s global knowledge and local  expertise to enable timely and effective responses to the needs of the borrowers. Formal implementation support  missions and field visits covering all aspects of implementation will be conducted periodically during implementation. The  characteristics of the program necessitate that these implementation support missions will be longer than the standard  single province or agency engagement. Tables 8.1 and 8.2 outline the estimated inputs from different specialists and  resources required at different stages of Program implementation. "
