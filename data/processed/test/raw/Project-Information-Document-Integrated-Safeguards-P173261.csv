16,Other Decision (as needed)      B. Introduction and Context 
17,"  Country Context    After fourteen years of civil conflict (1989-2003) which destroyed key institutions, infrastructure and the economy,  Liberia has made considerable progress in the face of daunting challenges since its return to democratic governance in  2006.  The return to multi-party democracy in 2006 created a favorable environment for long-term reconstruction.  However, in 2014, the twin shocks of the Ebola crisis and the subsequent sharp fall in commodity prices had a severe  negative impact on the Liberian economy. The fiscal impact remains acute. The GoL will continue to need exceptional  support from development partners to help with the resulting persistent financing gap. Such support will be crucial to  maintain the delivery of key services, including solid waste management (SWM). "
18,"Despite the World Bank’s interventions in constructing critical solid waste infrastructure through the Emergency Urban  Sanitation project (EMUS) (from 2009-2017) and the ongoing CLUS project (June 2017 to date), waste management  services in Greater Monrovia remain critically underfunded and sporadic. About 70% of the population of Greater  Monrovia lives in slums lacking affordable and adequate housing, basic services and critical infrastructure, and secure  land tenure. More than half of the population, especially poor households including female headed households, elderly  persons, youth and children are amongst those living in communities with low to no waste collection systems, or living  near poorly evacuated waste management sites, despite the effort made in the recent years by development partners  through the EMUS then the CLUS project. "
19,"  Sectoral and Institutional Context    Solid waste management is recognized as a critical service in the Greater Monrovia area which experiences regular  flooding (due to the accumulation of waste in drains) and rising sea level. In addition, poor sanitation and lack of proper  waste management could weaken the country’s effort to build resilience to potential infectious diseases after the  devastation wrought by Ebola in 2014.  Improved in waste management also has the potential to create skilled and  unskilled jobs in the waste and recycling sector and greater levels of social cohesion through engagement and behavior  change around waste issues. This outcome aligns well with Liberia’s new Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and "

22,Development (PPAPD) which was enacted following the change in government in 2018.    
23,"The majority of the street sweepers and waste-pickers are female; and they are generally considered a vulnerable sub- population. Most female street sweepers and waste-pickers are head of households and are highly vulnerable due to a  lack of alternative livelihood options. Despite working in very difficult conditions, female street sweepers and waste  pickers are cash labors who are seldom paid on regular basis due to the limitation in the financial resources faced by  MCC and PCC.   This can lead to extortion and sexual exploitation.  This leads to income disparities which in turn leads  to increased incidence of social and economic vulnerability of women-waste pickers. Global evidence suggests informal  female waste pickers often have access to less profitable waste than males and can receive less revenue than males  from selling equivalent quality and quantities of recoverable waste. Global evidence also suggests that private sector  contractors are more likely to underpay women than men.    "
24,"The CLUS project was designed and approved  in 2017 to support Liberia to build the fundamentals of a solid waste  management system in the Greater Monrovia (Monrovia, Paynesville and surrounding townships).and contribute to the  GoL’s Medium Term Economic Growth and Development Strategy (2013-2017). At the time f appraisal of the original  project,  it was aligned with the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for FY 13-16, which included a focus on  public health, disaster risk management, and urban management, as well as the Liberian Agenda for Transformation  (AfT) which was the country’s development agenda at the time of the project appraisal. The AfT prioritized development  of a comprehensive solid waste management strategy and aimed to expand equitable access to environmentally- friendly solid waste management services, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable, while reducing disposal of  solid waste in unmanaged sites.  The CLUS project contributes to the Objective 8 of the new  Liberia Country Partnership  Franmework (CPF) adopted on October 26, 2018 which aims  at supporting Liberia in creating  more-resilient urban  environments and rural communities.  Following the change in government in 2018, a new Pro-Poor Agenda for  Prosperity and Development (PPAPD) was enacted. The project remains consistent with the PPAPD which aimed, among  other objectives, to improve the institutional, policy and legal constraints/barriers to waste management at the national  and local levels.    "
25,"The specific objective of the CLUS parent project was to provide improved access to solid waste management (SWM)  services in Greater Monrovia through: (i) the construction of the Cheesemanburg landfill; (ii) the closure of the Whein  Town landfill; and (iii) improvement to existing transfer stations. The project is also designed to sustain existing  employment associated with solid waste collection, transportation and disposal, as well as support capacity-building  activities for municipal staff of Monrovia and surrounding townships.

34,"D. Project Description     The proposed AF will include the restructuring of the parent CLUS project, with respect to: (i) the extension of the  closing date to June 2023 (taking into consideration the time needed for completion of the physical infrastructure and  supporting the first years of the Cheesemanburg landfill operation); and (ii) changes to the existing institutional  arrangements, strengthening of technical expertise and enhancing monitoring and evaluation support systems for  efficient data collection and metrics for monitoring.    The three proposed components and resultant activities under the additional financing will include:    Component 1: Construction of the Cheesemanburg Regional Landfill and Closure of the Whein Town Landfill:    "
35,"• The construction of the Cheesemanburg Landfill.  This was originally budgeted at $US 3.5 million (and was  limited to construction of one cell) due to the limited budget at the time of the project design. Topographic  surveys of the site, as well as recently completed hydrogeological studies, have shown that the site is hilly  with a high groundwater table, which will result in larger earthworks than initially anticipated. With solid  waste generated within the Greater Monrovia area expected to increase, it is critical to design a two-cell   landfill and include additional adjacent facilities to reduce waste going to the landfill (e.g. a larger leachate  collection pond to accommodate the two cells, a composting plant, a recycling platform, a vehicle  maintenance facility, a field office,  etc.). The revised cost estimate for the Cheesemanburg Landfill is around  US$US 6.1 million.  "
36,"• Transfer Stations. Due to limited budget, the original CLUS project planned the minor rehabilitation of the  two existing transfer stations (including activities such as painting, and the rehabilitation of bathrooms etc.).  It has since become clear that additional improvements of the existing transfer stations are needed to  address some of the deficiencies noted during implementation missions, such as the flow of leachate to the  surrounding environment, the need to replace the canopy to prevent blowing debris, and other activities. It  is also necessary to start the identification of technical and safeguard studies for an additional transfer  station in the Greater Monrovia area. The financing of such a transfer station will be considered for future  additional financing (if available) or through other donors. The cost of the site identification, safeguard  studies and technical design will be covered by this project.  "
37,"• Additional collection equipment. Under the original project, the purchasing of equipment was benefitted  mainly by MCC, and PCC to a lesser extent, as it had no existing waste collection equipment at the beginning  of the project. Under the additional financing, the project will purchase more equipment, mainly for PCC  (but also MCC), to fully eliminate the high costs incurred with the equipment rental. There will also be  provisions to assist the two local governments with capacity building for equipment maintenance. Given the  long distance between the Cheesemanburg landfill to the city center, large collection vehicles (tipping  trailers) will need to be acquired for nighttime waste hauling to the Cheesemanburg landfill in order to  ensure cost-efficient waste transport. The project will also support the purchase of equipment and personal  protective gear for street sweepers, the majority of whom are female.  "
38,• Introduction of a Results-based financing for waste management in Greater Monrovia:  The Grant from  GPRBA under this AF will support the implementation of an innovative model of a results-based financing 
39,The World Bank   Cheesemanburg Landfill and Urban Sanitation project - AF1 (P173261) 
40,"   Feb 11, 2020 Page 7 of 17  "
41,"(RBF) where service providers (MCC, PCC, CBEs, and other relevant stakeholders) will receive transitional  subsidies to partially support the waste collection and disposal costs.  This transitional subsidy will support  service quality improvements and will supplement service fee collections in the primary and secondary  collection- provided that the service meets minimum quality standards. The subsidy is calculated to gradually  phase out as the cost recovery increases every year. Quarterly subsidy allocations to the service providers  from the RBF designated account will be calculated based upon the score achieved through the assessment  of the IVA.  The IVA will also conduct random, spot-checks in the field to assess whether performance data  collected by the M&E team represent ‘real world’ performance. This report from the IVA for one quarter will  determine how much each beneficiary service provider will be allowed to spend in the next quarter.  Disbursement from the RBF account for will be subject to World Bank procurement and financial  management regulations. The RBF will be specified in the Manual of Operations.  "
42,"• Narrowing gender gap through targeted actions: To narrow the gender gaps described earlier, a set of  activities specifically dedicated to female street sweepers will be supported by the AF. This includes: (i)  providing training to female waste pickers and female street sweepers on Health and Safety and GBV issues  (ii) providing free personal protective gear to waste pickers including those designed for women (iii)  providing street signage to reduce or eliminate accidents; (iv) providing where possible solar-powered  lighting at the locations identified as risky areas to protect female street sweepers and waste pickers working  at night against GBV risks (iv) providing dedicated skills development training and coaching to selected  female street sweepers who are willing to improve their livelihood.  "
43,• Enhanced Monitoring Program: The additional financing resources will be used to increase the 
44,frequency and number of monitoring points for the groundwater and surface water at the Whein 
45,Town landfill and near the transfer stations. A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) team will be 
46,created at PCC and MCC to support the local governments with daily monitoring of the 
47,"performance of waste management services in the city, as well as to address grievances and "
48,ensure that the waste management sites are kept clean.  The M&E team will liaise with the 
49,safeguard specialist on any environmental and social safeguards issues. Regular reports will be 
50,used by the independent verification agent to estimate payments under the RBF Grant 
51,mechanism.  The development of the M&E system will also help leverage female 
52,entrepreneurship in developing information technology (IT) tools for M&E.  
53,• Enhanced Communities Support Program: The behavior of communities is a key criterion for 
54,"success of the project. In addition, the Grievance Redress Mechanism has surfaced complaints "
55,"and requests during project implementation from communities, in particular, those living near "
56,"the waste management facilities. During project implementation, small interventions to "
57,communities living near waste management sites was effective in building a good relationship 
58,"and changing behavior. Previous interventions included, for example, distribution of mosquito "
59,"nets to Whein Town community, provision of waste collection buckets to the Cheesemanburg "
60,"community, among others.  Health programs benefitting waste workers, in particular female "
61,"workers and people living near the waste management facilities, will also be considered on the "
62,case by case basis to enhance the benefit of the project to local communities.

65,"Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  The project will continue to be implemented by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the MCC; and the PIU will  be reinforced with additional positions, such as: (i) a Technical Specialist with a strong engineering background to assist  the project coordinator with technical tasks; (ii) a Communications Specialist to implement the project’s communications  strategy; and (iii) Monitoring and Evaluation Teams within MCC and PCC to report to the PIU, and tasked with collecting  data for the RBF payments and supporting the day-to-day implementation of project activities.    The AF will introduce a Project Steering Committee (PSC) which will oversee the implementation of the project and  necessary high-level decisions. The PSC will be chaired by the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and will comprise of  representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Works, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of  Liberia, the Monrovia City Corporation (MCC) and the Paynesville City Corporation (PCC).  The Steering Committee will  provide high-level oversight of the implementation and approval of the annual budget prior to the submission to the Bank  for no objection.         .     F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)   "
66,"The site for construction of the new landfill site is located in Cheesemanburg Township, Montserrado  County. The site is an agricultural site but probably had been reserved over the years on shifting cultivation  basis and predominantly covered by secondary vegetation. The Po River and the Dima Creek run along the  eastern and southern boundaries of the site, respectively. The construction and operation of the landfill may  have minimal negative impact on these water bodies as they are not located within the immediate environs  of the site. There are several communities in the surrounding areas of the site but not in the immediate  vicinity of the site to trigger a relocation. However, agricultural lands acquired for the construction of the  landfill site will reduce the area of agricultural land available for affected families or households in the area.  The Stockton Creek and Fiamah transfer stations were built in 2009 in the township of Monrovia. Over time,  residence have built in close proximity to these sites. Although the sites are fenced. Irregular waste  collection of waste from the transfer sites generates Odor and insects affecting close by residents. The  Wheintown landfill is the only Landfill in Greater Monrovia and was identified and developed as an  emergency measure under Emergency Monrovia Urban Sanitation Project (EMUS) in 2006. This Landfill  however is reaching its useful life. Partial closure activities have commenced but the project had to deal  with pre-existing complaints of air pollution due to intermittent fire outbreaks from the landfill site. The  original project has financed the construction of a fence and partial capping to reduce and control the fires. "

71,"Activities proposed under the AF are not expected to  increase the environmental risks and impacts of the  parent project. OP/BP 4.01 had been triggered for  the parent project, and the project rated as Category  B. The landfill construction will involve several civil  works and waste management activities that have  the potential to adversely impact the biophysical  environment as well as the health and safety of the  public in the surrounding areas and those involved  directly involved with the project activities as  described in the project ESIA. Given the nature of  this project, potential adverse impacts may arise  during all stages of the project including  construction, operation and post-closure phases. A  detailed ESIA which includes a detailed ESMP has  been developed to ensure that all associated  environmental and social impacts are clearly  identified with defined mitigation measures and  monitoring activities provided. The ESIA was  provisionally cleared and approved by the Bank and  Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia,  respectively, subject to updating and re-disclosure  after the completion of a detailed hydrogeological  assessment. The hydrogeological assessment has  been completed, and the ESIA is being updated to  include the findings of the hydrogeological  assessment. The ESIA will also be updated to include  construction of  a new cell and ancillary facilities,  while the ESMPs for the existing transfer stations  will be revised to incorporate the renovation works  proposed under Component 1 of the AF.   The existing transfer stations at Fiamah and Stockton  Creek which were constructed under the Emergency  Monrovia Urban Sanitation (EMUS) Project will  continue to be operated under this project.  Operation of these existing transfer stations and  waste collection points have the potential to  generate adverse environmental and social impacts "

74,"as well as health and safety risks and hazards for the  public and those directly involved in waste  management works, including waste pickers and  transfer station management staff. Both transfer  stations have stand-alone ESMPs that were  developed under EMUS and disclosed on Info Shop  on March 16, 2010. "
75,The project activities will not have any impacts on  natural habitats. The site has been used for farming  for decades and is predominantly covered by  secondary vegetation. No sensitive ecosystems will  be affected by the project.

77,"Pest Management OP 4.09 No  The project activities do not involve procurement,  transportation or storage of pesticides or pesticide  application equipment. "
78,"There are no recognized physical cultural resources  in the project area. However, OP/BP 4.11 has been  triggered for precautionary reason since the  construction of the landfill includes activities that  involve large excavation activities such as  construction of leachate pond and drainage system,  excavation of landfill cells/trenches and construction  of access roads. The ESIA includes a chance find  procedure that outlines the steps to be followed in  case of chance finds. "
79,Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No  This is not applicable to the project area and to  Liberia at large. 
80,The project has acquired 100 acres of land for the  construction of landfill site and buffer zones in the  township of Cheesemanburg. Additional land was  acquired for construction of a 4 km access road to  the proposed landfill site.  The proposed site is free  from physical relocation or loss of crop as the site is  an agricultural land but probably reserved for some  years now on shifting cultivation basis. An  Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) was  prepared and disclosed in-country and through  Infoshop in June 2017. Closure of the Wheintown

87," OPS_SAFEGUARD_SUMMARY_TBL  A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues    1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential  large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:  The AF will finance the scale up of activities under the parent project, enhance community support programs, enhance  project oversight and extend closing date of the parent project.  These activities will not raise the safeguard category  or trigger any new safeguard risks or policies other than the policies that are already covered in the parent project.  Construction of  the new landfill will  replace the Whein Town landfill,which is the only sanitary landfill in Liberia, and  expected to reach its useful end of life in 2 years. The overall environmental and public health impact of this project  will be positive in that it will reduce the amount of solid waste that is not collected and properly disposed of in  Monrovia.  Any potential adverse environmental and social impacts from construction and  operation of the proposed  Cheesemanburg Landfill as well as the existing transfer stations may relate to  pollution from leachate, gas emissions  from the poorly designed landfill site and overflowing from the transfer stations as well as health and safety risks to  the surrounding communities and workers especially those directly involved in the waste collection and disposal  activities. Closure of the existing landfill site will also impact the livelihood of current waste pickers scavanging on the  site. The project also has potential to attract migrant workers to seek employment and other procurement related  opportunities. Labor and employment issues and risk of Gender Based Violence (GBV) and sexual exploitation  involving workers and local women and girls may also emerge during project implementation.    2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:  The main source of potential long-term impact is the proposed landfill. It is expected that the acquired site will be  used for at least 50 years. During operation and post-closure phases, the site may not be used for other purposes in  the medium to long term. The site will need to be closed, and properly capped and fenced in once the site has reached  its end of useful life. Post-closure monitoring requirements are provided in the ESIA and will need to be strictly  followed by the MCC to ensure that potential long-term impacts are mitigated.    Siting a landfill site may also reduce  the land value of area for future sale. the project has included rehabilitation of the community feeder road and other  assistance to represent appropriate compensation measure. These were identified by the community as main  motivation for the release of land and have been incorporated into the project activities.    3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.  The ESIA for the project had considered several options for solid waste management, including the “do nothing”  scenario. Options explored included landfilling, incineration, sorting and recycling, aerobic and anaerobic digesting and  “do nothing” scenario. Whilst sorting and recycling diverts a significant portion of the waste stream into useful by-"
88,The World Bank   Cheesemanburg Landfill and Urban Sanitation project - AF1 (P173261) 
89,"   Feb 11, 2020 Page 12 of 17  "
90,"products, this option alone does not solve the waste problem, since all the wastes generated cannot be recycled. This  option has to be considered in the context of an integrated waste management program with the objective of  reducing the amount of waste to be landfilled. Aerobic and anaerobic digesting also require other waste management  options such as recycling, sorting and landfilling in order to be complete and to meet the project objectives. Several  sites were also considered in order to minimize the environmental, social and public health impacts of the project. The  MCC in 2014 hired a consultant who provided technical support for the selection of the landfill site. Five candidate  sites were considered for the development of the landfill. Several criteria, including public acceptance, topography,  geology, hydrology, biodiversity (flora and fauna), socio-economic impacts, resettlement etc were considered before  settling for the current Cheesemanburg site. After considering all these factors, the Cheesemanburg site was found to  be the best site.    4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower  capacity to plan and implement the measures described.  Safeguards policies triggered by this project include OP 4.01, OP 4.12 and OP 4.11. The MCC hired an independent  environmental consultancy firm to conduct an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the project. The  ESIA was conducted in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment requirements of the Environmental Protection  and Management Law of Liberia. No stand-alone document has been developed to address OP 4.11. The OP has been  triggered as matter of precaution. Even though there are no recognized physical cultural resources in the project area,  some project activities involve large excavation. The ESIA thus includes a Chance Find Procedure that outlines steps to  be followed in case of chance finds. The project involves the acquisition of land for the development of the landfill and  have prepared an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) in compliance with OP4.12. The ARAP and the ESIA  have been disclosed in country and in the Bank’s InfoShop. The disclosed ESIA is being updated to incorporate the  findings  of the hydrogeological assessment. Stand-alone ESMPs for exsiting transfer stations were developed and  disclosed on Info Shop on March 16, 2010. As part of the closure plans for the Wheintown Landfill site, the project has  launched an Environmental and social audit to inform the closure design options, operation of existing transfer  stations, and the development a post-closure monitoring and maintenance plan as well as ESMP during construction.  A livelihood Restoration Plan will also be prepared and implemented for the current waste pickers prior to initiating  the closure of the Whein Town landfill. The scope of the Social and Environment Audit will expand to include the 2  transfer stations and the ESMPs updated.    With respect to environmental and social safeguards, the project will be delivered in three main phases including  design and construction, operation, and post-closure. These phases, except the post-closure phase, will be managed  by independent contractors. The ESIA has identified potential environmental and social impacts that are associated  with each phase, and the mitigation measures required to manage these impacts. The MCC will ensure that these  responsibilities are included in the contracts of the various contractors. To ensure that these responsibilities are  contractually enforceable and that resources are allocated for their implementation by the contractors, the  environmental and social measures in the ESIA and ESMP will be a part of the bidding package for the design and  construction contract as well as the landfill operation (including the transfer stations) contract. Prior to the start of  construction and operation of the landfill and its ancillary structures, the contracting entity will be required to develop  a Contractor Environmental, Social, Health and Safety Management Plan to be approved by the PIU.     The Plans should incorporate the mitigation measures provided in the ESMP. MCC will hire an Owner’s Engineer (OE)  given the low capacity of the MCC to monitor and ensure that construction works are undertaken according to  specification. The OE would be delegated the responsibility to supervise the construction contractor’s implementation  of the project approved environmental and social safeguards instruments, including those of the contractors’ own  Environmental, Social, Health and Safety Management Plan.

93,"  Gender mainstreaming and mitigating the risk of GBV are well considered under the project and will be extended for  this AF. Taking into account the recommendations of the World Bank Good Practice Note on addressing GBV in major  civil works, the project has defined some mitigation and response measures including  (i) promotion of hiring workers  from the vicinity of the project (ii) Contractual obligations that will require the contractor for a Code of Conduct (CoC)  and trainings on their obligations under the CoC on SEA and SH, as well a well-developed GBV Action Plan (iii) clear  GBV referral pathway, a GBV sensitive GRM and GBV awareness creation strategies The project has established a  Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) which is functional. Complaints received so far have been related to operations  at the Wheintown Landfill site as civil works for the new construction have are yet to begin.    The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will have overall responsibility for E&S implementing and management. As per  the project design, staffing for E&S risk management is duly constituted. This comprise a safeguards officer and a  Community Liaison Officer. The project will also add to the team a communications officer. This team exercises direct  responsibility for E&S management and the existing capacity is sufficient to accommodate the additional tasks that are  related to this AF.      5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies,  with an emphasis on potentially affected people.  The key stakeholders are the people of Monrovia and Cheesemanburg, especially those communities around the  landfill in Cheesemanburg and the transfer stations in Fiamah and Stockton Creek areas and Wheintown community.   A subgroup of people who were extensively consulted was the families from which the land was acquired.  The project  has held several community consultations at project preparation and ongoing during implementation . As part of the  ESIA process, the ESIA Consultant conducted public consultations twice - during the scoping stage and after the final  draft of the ESIA was prepared.     The project has prepared a stakeholder Engagement Plan to guide engagements throughout project implementation  through to closure. It has also established a community monitoring groups for collaboration in project monitoring as  part of its Citizen’s Engagement Mechanisms.    In addition to the Safeguards Officer and the Community Liaison Officer, a communication officer  will also be  recruited and this team will provide oversight to the implementation of  SEP and GRM.    Existing ESMPs for the Fiamah and Stockton Creek Transfer Stations may be updated based on the findings of the  environmental and social audit and will be re-disclosed for this project. All disclosures will occur prior to  commencement of any activities with potential adverse impacts. No civil work activities will start prior to the  disclosure of these safeguards instrument.           "
