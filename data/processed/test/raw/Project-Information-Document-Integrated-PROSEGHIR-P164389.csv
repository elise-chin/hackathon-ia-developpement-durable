15,"  1. Mexico is an upper-middle income country with a diversified economy, but moderate economic growth  has limited significant poverty reduction and income convergence. Growth averaged about 2 percent between  1980 and 2018, or close to 1 percent on a per capita basis. The country’s per capita gross domestic product (GDP)  stands at 34 percent of U.S. per capita GDP, compared with 49 percent back in 1980. On average, over the last 25  years, total factor productivity (TFP) growth has been negative. The official multidimensional poverty rate fell from  44.4 percent of the population in 2016 to 41.9 percent in 2018, while the share of the population living below the  monetary poverty line in 2018 was 48.8 percent, close to the level observed in 2008. Moreover, regional inequality  is high.  After a decline in 2010–14, the annualized growth rate of median per capita income was 1.8 percent in  2016–18, still well below the average in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region.     2. Public investment has been low, and the gaps in infrastructure have been widening over the last 30  years, hampering broad-based income growth. Public investment reached an average of only 3.2 percent of GDP  between 2008 and 2015.1 Excluding Pemex, the share would be only 1.7 percent of GDP in average over the last  years. This falls short of rapidly growing Latin American countries and emerging economies that spend above 5  percent of GDP in this area.  Gaps have been widening across sectors, including transport, energy, housing and  urban infrastructure, and water.     3. Water infrastructure is particularly affected by underinvestment with highly negative potential  consequences to the welfare of the population and the economy.  More than 35 million Mexicans have limited  access to water or receive low-quality water services.  More than a hundred of the country’s 731 watersheds face  severe shortages, and the number of overexploited aquifers tripled between 1975 and 2013.2 Overall, water  availability per capita has reduced drastically, from 18,035 to 3,982 m3/inhabitant per year between 1950 and  2013.       4. The deceleration in economic activity underway since Q2 2018 continued in 2019, but Mexico maintains  a prudent macroeconomic policy framework. On the demand side, despite real wage growth and strong  remittance inflows in 2019, private consumption growth dipped to its slowest pace in the last years. Dragged by  wage and other recurrent spending cuts in public administration, government consumption also slowed  significantly over the first half of 2019. A degree of uncertainty around the trajectory of some of the new "

19,"administration’s sectoral policies, slowed investment further, which had been weak since 2016. In this context,  inflation pressures continue to subside even with the significant minimum wage increase enacted at the beginning  of the year.  The policy rate has helped the local currency to hover below 20 pesos per dollar, as Mexico remains  attractive to portfolio investors, but with less positive effects for fixed capital formation. Fiscal consolidation  enabled the achievement of public debt stabilization.  Mexico led emerging markets in stabilizing and then  reducing public debt as a share of GDP, which stood at 53.6 percent in 2018 for gross public-sector debt (44.9  percent on a net basis as reported by the government). Expenditure rationalization measures plus the use its  revenue stabilization fund broadly enable the authorities to compensate for lower than expected revenue  collection during 2019. Adherence to fiscal prudence is expected to continue as the administration presented its  2020 budget with a primary surplus and an overall fiscal deficit in line with the objective of stabilizing the public  debt-to-GDP ratio. The budget emphasizes categorical social programs (minimum pension, student grants and  stipends for youth) and a moderate public investment increase, which are financed by program consolidation and  cuts in public wages, goods and services, and discretionary transfers to states.   "
20,"5. Water stress is a critical vulnerability for Mexico, including in the context of climate change. As the  country’s population has grown, water availability per capita has fallen sharply, dropping from 18,035 m3 per  year in 1950 to 3,392 m3 per year in 2015. The National Water Commission (Comisión Nacional del Agua,  CONAGUA) projects that water resources per capita will reach 3,250 m3 by 2030.3 More than 35 million Mexicans  have limited access to water or receive low-quality water services. Moreover, rising global temperatures and  shifting precipitation patterns are already affecting the country’s hydrological cycles, and the increasing strain on  the country’s scarce water resources is leading to the overexploitation of groundwater and productivity losses.  Groundwater provides more than 65 percent of all water used by Mexican cities. Pumping out underground  water causes land subsidence (or sinking), which makes flooding worse and significant structural damages to  urban infrastructures. For example, subsidence levels (sinking) in Mexico City are observed over 30 centimeters  per year.  The economic costs of water depletion and degradation have increased over the last 15 years.   "
21,"6. The water sector would require significant, innovative and complex investments, together with  increased institutional capacity, to provide water with sustainability to the population. Limited investment in  key water management infrastructure is exposing Mexico to higher climate and non-climatic related risks while  increasing opportunity costs of underinvestment. Mexico has a large network of dams with 150km3 stored in 667  facilities. However, many of them were built more than 50 years ago, and increased investment in maintenance  and rehabilitation are pressing to ensure their continued operation, protect local populations from potential dam  failures, improve energy efficiency of hydropower generation, and provide a more reliable service to the  population. Moreover, tightening fiscal space is constraining investment. The authorities are open to public- private investments in the sector, particularly downstream in the sector. But an ambitious program to  strengthening the planning, funding and implementation functions is critical for that and enhance the delivery  capacity of the water system and infrastructure in the country.   "
22,"7. The Valley of Mexico region has one of the highest water stress4 levels of the country. This area of the  country generates an estimated 38 percent of Mexico’s GDP (including the Valley of México Metropolitan Area - VMMA and Toluca Metropolitan Area -TMA). Together, these two metropolitan areas account for a population "

Valley of Mexico has the  highest water stress index in Mexico; 140%, meaning that it uses 40% more water that what is renewed.  "

26,"of almost 23.4 million people and host a diverse range of economic activities, from manufacturing to agricultural  farmland, that require water for both consumption and economic development. Nevertheless, deficient water  services, compounded by unreliable bulk water supply, impose economic costs on households and firms  equivalent to an estimated 1 percent of the GDP of the VMMA.5 With an estimated population of 21.5 million,  the VMMA is considered the most populated urban center in Latin America, and currently demands a mean water  supply of 63 cubic meters per second (m3/s)6 for human consumption and industrial and commercial needs and  an estimated supply of 11 m3/s for irrigation purpose. The TMA houses a population of approximately 1.9 million  people with a mean water demand of 4.7 m3/s.7 The bulk water supply and water service provision for these two  areas constitute a major challenge for the country.  The Cutzamala System plays an essential role in the supply  of water for the VMMA and TMA.   Furthermore, many of the Cutzamala System’s dams, which date from the  mid-1900s, require rehabilitation and safety improvements to address critical dam safety issues.  The Cutzamala  System is an energy intensive and energy-inefficient system.  The VMMA and TMA depend on the Cutzamala  System as a main water provider, but also as a buffer for water shocks, including seismic events.   Multiple federal  and local entities are involved in the management of the Cutzamala System.  Additionally, the VMMA relies on  the pumping of groundwater from aquifers for human consumption, industrial and commercial use, and irrigated  agriculture.  The ongoing overdraft of groundwater in the VMMA has resulted in significant land subsidence,  damaging urban infrastructure and posing challenges to water supply.   "

The topography in the area is characterized by hills, mountain ranges, deep ravines and  relatively extensive valleys. Currently, there is an important deterioration of water quality in the sub-basins  due to deficient sanitation infrastructure and direct discharge of untreated wastewater into watercourses.

44,"retention of sediments and nutrients. Predominant soils (andosols) are characterized by very low bulk  density and, being devoid of vegetation and located on slopes and hills, are highly vulnerable to water and  wind erosion. Overall, the Cutzamala System faces important environmental challenges, including a process  of overall degradation of the ecosystems due to varied anthropogenic activities. Consequently, it is  necessary to optimize the use of water and stop the processes of water and soil contamination, soil  degradation and deterioration of the adjacent natural habitats. The latter include two federal Protected  Natural Areas (APN): The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve and Valle de Bravo, Malacatepec, Tilostoc  and Temascaltepec River Basins Protected Natural Resources Area. Regarding social aspects, Mazahua  indigenous people are present in the Project area. Component 2 will be developed in the lowest and most  horizontal plain of the Valley of Mexico, which is highly urbanized and corresponds to the surface occupied  by four large lakes and surrounding hillside plots. The groundwater in this basin has been exploited for  decades for drinking water supply and water supply for agricultural and industrial activities, and the  extraction and demand are increasing. Currently, 68 percent of the water used in the Valley of Mexico is  pumped from groundwater leading to aquifer overexploitation and differential land subsidence and damage  to existing infrastructure. This situation is aggravated by loss of permeable surface and reduction of  vegetation and recharge zones due to expansion of the urban area. Project activities will mitigate impacts of  overexploitation of the aquifers and contribute to improve the reliability of the Cutzamala System, among  other benefits. A full description of the Cutzamala’s System environmental aspects is available at  http://documentos.bancomundial.org/curated/es/309801468189248037/Cutzamala-Diagnostico-integral  "

50,"pilot sites for recharging the aquifer with treated  wastewater. The works involve the instrumentation,  civil works and mechanical equipment for the  rehabilitation of the Cutzamala System Dams; as well  as upgrading of existing wastewater treatment  plants to improve wastewater effluent quality by  incorporating advanced treatment modules to  comply with Mexican water quality discharge  standards for aquifer recharge; aquifer recharge  wells; and conveyance infrastructure from the waste  water treatment plants (WWTPs) to the recharge  wells. The identified environmental risks and  potential negative impacts include generation of  dust, gases and noise on the atmoshpere, derived  from the movement of materials and operation of  machinery and equipment and contamination of soil  and water due to improper handling of chemicals,  construction waste and/or hazardous waste  (storage, transport and final disposal). The identified  occupational health and safety (OHS) risks and  potential impacts include damage to health and  physical integrity of Project workers resulting from  improper handling of chemical products and waste;  accidents due to inadequate traffic signals and  safety signs on work sites; and OHS issues due to  lack of personal protective equipment or training in  the use of tools and equipment.    All these works and activities also have positive  environmental and social impacts and support the  efficient use of water resources in the area.  The Project includes works and activities for which  the corresponding detailed engineering designs will  be developed during Project implementation, and  their realization may involve construction  procedures and technologies that remain to be  defined. Consequently, CONAGUA has prepared,  consulted and disclosed an Environmental and Social  Management Framework (ESMF), which includes an  exclusion list, selection and evaluation procedure to  identify, evaluate and manage the possible impacts  and environmental and social risks under each  contract. Both CONAGUA and the works’ contractors  will apply the ESMF that covers the environmental  and social requirements for the contractors that will  be included in the bidding documents and "

53,"contracts.The ESMF includes the selection of works  and the assignment of environmental and social  obligations in accordance with the applicable  national legislation e.g. on environment, health and  safety at work. It also proposes a set of good  environmental, safety and hygiene practices to be  applied in different types of activities. Likewise, the  ESMF includes the establishment of efficient  mechanisms for the reception and attention of  potential complaints and other feedback from  stakeholders during the development of the works.    The supervision of Project activities will include  evaluation of compliance with environmental, social,  health and safety and cultural requirements.  CONAGUA and the Project contractors will be  responsible for the environmental, social and health  and safety (ESHS) management. Strong  environmental clauses in terms of reference and  contracts will indicate the obligation of the  participating contractors to have the necessary  management capacity related to ESHS aspects.    The ESMF was consulted on December 7 and 8, 2017  and the results of these consultations were reflected  in the ESMF. The ESMF was disclosed at the  CONAGUA and World Bank external websites on  January 15, 2018, and the updated version in  December 2019  to reflect the reduced scope of the  Project investments with the final loan amount of  US$ 120 million instead of US$ 200 million.

70,"The Project activates OP 4.37 on Safety of Dams as it  will support CONAGUA’s ongoing dam safety efforts,  through the following activities for the Cutzamala  System Dams: (i) instrumentation of the dams  (under Sub-component 1.1); (ii) civil works, electrical  and mechanical equipment for the dam  rehabilitation (under Sub-Component 1.2); and (iii)  the development of operational and maintenance  plans and emergency preparedness plans for the  dams (under Sub-Component 1.2). Additionally, an  independent panel of experts will have the following  responsibilities: (i) reviewing the risk-based dam  safety assessments, safety inspection reports,  operations and maintenance plans and emergency  preparedness plans, all for the Cutzamala System  Dams; (ii) advising on the design and  implementation of rehabilitation works required for  the Cutzamala System Dams; and (iii) reviewing the  investigation, design and implementation of high- hazard cases involving significant and complex  remedial works.     To date, CONAGUA has established national dam  safety standards within the framework of the  National Water Law and the Federal Law on  Metrology and Standardization and its Regulations.  The two main norms regarding dam safety operation  were published in the Official Journal of the  Federation in 2015: NMX-AA-175-SCFI-2015: Safe  Dam Operation – Part 1 – Risk Analysis and  Classification of Dams and in 2016: NMX-AA-175-"

76,"  A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues    1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential  large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:  The Project is classified as Environmental Category B under OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, and its overall  safeguards risk at the Appraisal stage is rated “Substantial”, the Environmental Risk being Substantial. Even if most of  the Project works and activities consist of improving existing infrastructure, the environmental risk is Substantial due  to dam safety aspects and the location of the civil works envisioned under Component 1 in two Protected Natural  Areas (ANP). Overall, the Project is expected to produce positive environmental and social impacts through improved  water management in the Valley of Mexico. No large-scale, significant or irreversible environmental impacts are "

79,"expected. CONAGUA has developed an ESMF to guide the management of the Project to further reduce  environmental and social risks and potential negative impacts and maximize positive impacts.    The Project’s Social Risk at the Appraisal stage is rated “Moderate”, and OP 4.10 and OP 4.12 are triggered. CONAGUA  has developed a Social Assessment (SA), IPPF and RPF. The SA and further monitoring during Project preparation  concluded that the Project is not expected to generate negative social impacts on indigenous peoples or other  stakeholders. The Project alleviates risk of water shortages and social disruptions and improves community safety due  to closing of nearby, now partly open canals. No involuntary land taking is expected as the Project will be  implemented on government-owned land.    Dam Safety  CONAGUA has undertaken dam safety assessment of Cutzamala’s System Dams and shared it with the Bank. Some  critical dam safety issues have not been sufficiently captured by these reports. Given more strategic and intensive use  of some storage dams, the safety and sustainability of the storage dams will be a critical consideration for successful  Project implementation. Also, the dam safety assessment and management capacity needs to be enhanced in line with  the 2015 Mexican dam safety regulations. The emergency preparedness plans and operation and maintenance plans  will be prepared based on proper dam safety risk and downstream consequence assessment given their high hazard of  downstream areas.    2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:  No indirect and/or long term negative impacts are foreseen due to anticipated future activities in the Project area.    3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.  Not applicable.    4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower  capacity to plan and implement the measures described.  CONAGUA has proven knowledge and experience in applying World Bank safeguard policies through several Bank- financed projects. All capacity building activities incorporate relevant safeguard principles and Environmental, Social,  Health and Safety (ESHS) good practices. CONAGUA has successfully developed and managed mechanisms to deal with  complaints, suggestions and requests for information based on the country’s legal regulations: Constitution of the  United States of Mexico, Federal Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information, and Federal Law on  Administrative Responsibilities of Public Servants, among others.     Within CONAGUA, the implementation of the safeguards instruments will rely on a Safeguards Area within the Project  Implementation Unit (PIU). Currently six staff are responsible for overseeing activities and implement, document, and  follow up the activities of consultation, participation, dissemination and coordination related to the Project  implementation, including activities related to compliance with the environmental and social safeguards and related  reporting.    The supervision of Project activities will include evaluation of compliance with ESHS requirements, including cultural  aspects. CONAGUA and the Project contractors will be responsible for the ESHS management of the Project works.  Strong environmental clauses will be included in the terms of reference and contracts to indicate the obligation of the  participating contractors to have the necessary management capacity related to ESHS aspects. Moreover, Component  3 and the ESMF foresee opportune capacity building measures.    "

82,"Dam Safety    CONAGUA will undertake a more comprehensive risk-based dam safety assessment as per the 2015 Mexican dam  safety regulations for eight Cutzamala System Dams as pilots, through which CONAGUA would enhance its capacity to  better comply with the recent dam safety regulations across the country. CONAGUA has agreed to establish an  independent panel of experts on dam safety, whose terms of reference and composition/qualification of the panelists  are subject to World Bank review. CONAGUA has also agreed to prepare/upgrade the operation and maintenance  plans and emergency preparedness plans for the dams based on proper safety risk and downstream hazard  assessments.    5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies,  with an emphasis on potentially affected people.  The Project’s stakeholders include public and private entities, including civil society, local communtiy leaders,  academics, researchers, water users, neighbors to the Project sites, state and federal government officials, as well as  the Mazahua, an indigenous peoples group present in the Valley of Mexico.     Two consultations were held:  1. Urban Area (Valley of Mexico). The first consultation was held on December 7, 2017 in the Delegación Gustavo A.  Madero, Mexico City. Participants included stakeholders from civil society, local community leaders, academics,  researchers, water users, neighbors to the Project sites, and state and federal government officials.   2. Rural area (Cutzamala). The second consultation was held on December 8, 2017, with stakeholders such as  community leaders, Mazahua representatives, civil society leaders, academics, researchers, water users, neighbors to  the Project sites, and state and federal government officials.    Feedback obtained during the consultations focused on Mazahua requests to national government to (i) strengthen  citizen participation mechanisms and mainstream communication and outreach efforts to indigenous communities; (ii)  allocate the equivalent of 5 percent of the total cost of works and infrastructure for the implementation of  infrastructure and community services; and (iii) ensure the continuation of the integrated basin management. The  feedback received through the consultation process was summarized and incorporated in each safeguard document  as appropriate.    After the consultations, the ESMF, IPPF and RPF were updated and disclosed by CONAGUA and the Bank on their  respective external websites on January 15, 2018. At the end of 2019, the instruments were updated to reflect the  reduced scope of the Project investments after confirming the final loan amount of US$ 120 million, and the revised  ESMF, IPPF and RPF were disclosed by CONAGUA and the Bank in December 2019.
