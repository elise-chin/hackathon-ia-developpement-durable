15,"The project description was amended on February  19, 1999, as follows: B.1 replace ""decontamination"" by ""cessation of operation"" B.2  deleted. B.4  delete ""a scrubber or a"". C.1  revised to read ""Installation of dust removal systems for the coke ovens and blast furnaces, and installation of   equipment for ammonium distillation and desulfurization "".  [Note:  this appears to have been a significant reduction in   project scope.] C.2  revised to read ""Provision of equipment for the construction of wastewater treatment plants ""."
16,"The project description was further amended in May  2002, following the October 2001 Mid-Term Review.  While the  text of this change was not available for review, the ICR reports that it cancelled remaining funds for ASMIDAL and   ENSIDER, on the understanding that the companies would complete their investments with their own resources, and   reallocated $10.5 million for a new component, A.2 Hazardous Waste Management, to establish a pilot hazardous  waste treatment facility.  The ICR is not clear whether this is the same facility as that described in the SAR under  V.  The Government's Parallel Program in Skikda, which includes production changes at a chlorine plant to avoid the use   of mercury, decontamination of the plant and construction of an engineered landfill for the disposal of   mercury-comtaminated sludge, and was at that time intended to be carried out with government and other funds .   However, a communication from the region has clarified that the new component did constitute the engineered landfill   referred to in the SAR but that the site was changed from Skikda to another site, causing considerable delays ."

Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and DatesComments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and DatesComments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and DatesComments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates     *  it is not clear from the ICR whether these figures include relevant expenditures by the enterprises ASMIDAL and   ENSIDER after the May 2002 amendment.The region has clarified that only  someexpenditures are included. **  From the ICR text, Section 5.4.  Annex 2 gives a total disbursement of $22.34 m but the sub-totals add to $23.50  m.(a rounding error, according to the region ) The original project cost estimates and financing plan appear to have been realistic, though the project scope was   perhaps more ambitious than could have been implemented .  The documents reviewed do not mention whether   efforts were made to attract grant cofinancing, which might have made borrowing for environmental protection more   palatable.  The decision to use an extended implementation period of eight years was justified by events .  Even  though the loan closed on time, the hazardous waste component added in  2002, had not proceeded beyond the   bidding stage by loan closure."
18," 3. Relevance of Objectives & Design : The project was consistent with the Bank's  1996 CAS and with Algeria's environmental management priorities .  The  combination of legal and institutional strengthening with action to mitigate two major pollution sources was both   appropriate and even necessary to ensure government commitment to borrowing for technical assistance activities .   The selection of ASMIDAL and ENSIDER also appears to have been appropriate, given the highly adverse impacts   their emissions were having on surrounding populations, as was the use of environmental audits to determine which   of the pollution problems should be tackled first, although the subsequent reduction in project scope may indicate   that the enterprises were less committed to the project objectives than first appeared .  Though not emphasized in the  SAR, the selection of investments which had worthwhile financial returns  (through energy savings or resource   recovery) must have eased enterprise cooperation .  While the SAR identified the main risks to timely and successful   project implementation, with hindsight it can be seen that the actions taken were insufficient to prevent major delays   and uncertainties during the early implementation period .  A smaller project might have reduced the political and   institutional risks."
19," 4. Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy) : Despite some reductions in project scope, the project achieved all three of its development objectives, though not to   the full extent envisaged at appraisal .  In particular, the ICR has no useful data on the achievement of the target of   reducing ENSIDER dust emissions from 40,000 ton/yr to 11,000 ton/yr.  However, the measured health impacts were   impressive, especially in the villages closest to the plants .  As the hazardous waste facility had not been built at the   time of loan closure, its outcome remains uncertain, though there is evidence that Algeria is strongly committed to its   completion and the Bank is continuing to supply non -lending services."
20,"Although Section 4.2 of the ICR does not clearly compare project outcomes with SAR projections, it appears that all  "
21,"the legislative/ institutional targets were achieved fully or in part and, in some cases, exceeded .  Given the embryonic  state of environmental management in Algeria when the project was prepared, it appears to have played a key role in   building national capacity, not least of which in the establishment of a credible compliance system for environmental   laws."
22," 5. Efficiency : While recognizing the expected benefits of legal and institutional strengthening, the SAR understandably focused its   quantitative analysis on the investment components and estimated economic rates of return of  29% for ASMIDAL  and 49% for ENSIDER based essentially on health benefits and some productivity benefits .  The ICR uses a broader  definition of benefits, including additional productivity gains and benefits to fisheries, which seem unquestionable .   More doubtful is the inclusion of increases in real estate values .  The ICR does not demonstrate that such increases   were a result of the project and, even if they were, they may represent double counting .  More generally, the ICR  does not present its results in a form directly comparable with the SAR, uses an opportunity cost of capital of  10%  rather than the 12% used at appraisal, misleadingly states that a financial rate of return was not calculated in the   SAR and was therefore not included in the ICR (the region has clarified that the actual reason was the   non-availability of financial data from the enterprises ), and presents no estimates at all for the added hazardous   waste component, though apparently a financial analysis was undertaken .  Moreover, Annex 3 consists only of  tables, without any explanatory notes on assumptions or methodology and therefore cannot be independently   checked."

28,"* Direct benefits plus avoided costs  (not further defined in the ICR) but needs further review to see if it includes   double counting.  Excludes hazardous waste. ** A communication from the region states that  ""A pre-feasibility study was carried out that established the financial   viability of the project from a private sector operator point of view "" and that later ""ways to provide incentives were  assessed""."
29,"Despite the ICR methodological and presentational deficiencies noted above, the evidence is clear that the ASMIDAL   and ENSIDER components were economically justified and anecdotal evidence  (including the fact that the  enterprises were willing to complete the investments with their own funds ) suggests that they were also viable in   financial terms - in other words, ""win-win"" solutions."
30," 6. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization: The SAR (Annex 5) gave a reasonable set of performance indicators and required that progress towards their   achievement be reported quarterly .  However, apart from including a pilot monitoring system in Annaba under   component A.3, the SAR does not describe how M&E would be carried out .  The ICR briefly mentions that an air   quality monitoring network was set up for Annaba and various laboratories established but there is no mention of   water monitoring, though the region has clarified that water monitoring has intensified ..  The ICR presentation on key  performance indicators is roughly comparable to the SAR format, but no results are presented for the following : dust  emissions from ENSIDER (a key pollutant); nitrogen oxides; and water pollution from oil and total suspended solids .   The reported SO2 emissions are 8,000 ton/yr, exactly the appraisal estimate, apparently an error .  However, some  useful health indicators are added in the ICR ."
31," 7. Other (Safeguards, Fiduciary, Unintended Impacts--Positive & Negative):  Safeguards The SAR has just two sentences on environmental impacts, though a much better section on social impacts   (especially employment).  EA Category B was appropriate for the project as appraised, but should have been   changed to A when the hazardous waste component was added; it is not clear from the ICR whether this happened .   The region has clarified that the management memo requesting approval for the project restructuring explicitly   mentions that the project would be changed to A but this apparently was not reflected in the SAP .  The region has  stated that the EA work done was of A category standards, including appropriate public consultation .  "
32,"The use of environmental audits for the two enterprises to characterize the pollution issues, set priorities and form   the basis for the design of Component B was very appropriate and pioneering for Algeria .    Also pioneering was the  use of environmental management performance agreements for the two enterprises and later for  25 additional firms.   There is no specific reference to measures to minimize negative environmental impacts of the project investments   (that is, an Environmental Management Plan), though one outcome of the ENSIDER component was said to be   ""targeted environmental management measures "".  This would surely have been an issue for the hazardous waste   component but no appraisal document  (or even detailed description) for that investment was available for review,   though it apprently exists in project files .    The SAR makes no reference to other safeguard policies and it is unlikely   that they should have been triggered for this project ."
33,"Despite the recommendations of the ICR guidelines, the ICR makes no reference at all to safeguard policies, the   extent to which they were applied, implementation experience and any unexpected negative outcomes ."
34,"Fiduciary Issues At appraisal, the project had relatively standard requirements for accounts and audits, reporting, and procurement   (which were revised through an amendment to the legal agreements on February  19, 1999), and depended on a new  PIU in an agency with almost no experience with international assistance .  The reported difficulties and delays in   procurement are therefore not surprising .  The ICR does not report any misprocurement or other fiscal irregularities .   The covenant on debt-service coverage for ASMIDAL and ENSIDER was deleted when they agreed to complete the   project investments with their own funds ."

However,  the ICR provides little information on the  addition of the hazardous waste   component and whether it followed  normal Bank standards of appraisal, peer   and management review and notification   to the Board.  Subsequent implementation  delays may indicate that it was added   prematurely to make use of available   funds.  "

41," 9. Lessons: 1.   Even in a country with no history of environmental protection, much can be achieved in a well -designed first "
42,"project, which balances capacity building with investments in pollution reduction . 2.   Picking the ""low hanging fruit"" in pollution reduction investments can often yield solutions that are financially   profitable for the enterprise, as well as beneficial for the environment . 3.  Adding major unrelated components to use up undisbursed loan balances should be done with the same rigor as   the appraisal of a stand-alone project, to maximize the chances for successful implementation . 4.  Voluntary environmental performance management agreements can be a powerful tool for a new environmental   agency."
43," 11. Comments on Quality of ICR:  The ICR is succinct and covers the main descriptive elements and issues reasonably well, although it could have   been enhanced with a number of tables clearly setting out comparisons of appraisal, revised and actual   achievements, with respect to: project description; performance indicators; cost estimates; financing plans; economic   and financial rates of return etc .  "
44,"However, a major issue regarding ICR quality is that the hazardous waste component is only sketchily described and   no information is given on its justification or the process by which it entered the project .  The reasons why, after three  years, it had only reached the bidding documents stage, are not clearly presented .  Its outcome should not have  been rated S, given that nothing had been constructed .  Other ICR shortcomings are:"
45,"Section 4.5 on institutional development impact is too sketchy� Annex 2 does not contain the standard tables comparing actual and appraisal project costs and financing plans .  � Three different figures are given for total Bank disbursements . The economic analysis is in a different form from that in the SAR and should be further reviewed for possible  � double counting Annex 3 does not provide basic supporting information on assumptions and methodology� No financial analysis is attempted� M&E systems are not mentioned or evaluated� There is no assessment of how safeguard issues were treated at appraisal, at the inclusion of the hazardous  � waste component and during implementation"
