0;Improving the management of natural resources at the landscape level is important to enhance the country s resilience to weather related events and for providing economic opportunities for rural economies 
1;Healthy agriculture and forest landscapes can offset some of the impacts of climate related disasters by enhancing the forest ecosystem s resilience to changing weather patterns  providing important safety nets for local communities to cope with climate shocks  enhancing the productivity of farming systems  and reducing damage from flooding and sea level rise  among others 
2;In addition  forest landscapes provide key ecosystem services such as biodiversity habitat  water filtration and availability  increased food security  soil erosion control  and reduction of Greenhouse Gases  GHG  emissions 
3;The unsustainable management of these natural assets negatively affect rural jobs and revenue generation  impacting economic growth and disproportionally affecting the rural poor and vulnerable communities 
4;The COVID 19 pandemic precipitates deforestation and forest degradation associated to an increased internal demand for food  raw material  and commodities  often satisfied through unsustainable farming systems   by August 2020  global deforestation rates had increased 77 percent during the pandemic 
5;Sustainable natural resources management and land restoration is the joint responsibility of two ministries 
6;The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources  Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales  MARN  is responsible for implementing the National Environmental Policy  which provides the framework for sustainable use of natural resource protection  conservation  and restoration of the environment 
7;The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock  Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganader a  MAG  administers the regulations for agriculture  irrigation  forestry  fisheries  and aquaculture 
8;MAG implements national regulations and planning through the General Directorate of Forestry  Watersheds  and Irrigation  Direcci n General Ordenamiento Forestal  Cuencas  y Riego  DGFCR  and provides extension and technology transfer through the National Agricultural and Forestry Technology Center  Centro Nacional de Tecnolog a Agropecuaria y Forestal  CENTA  
9;Locally  municipalities and local governments implement projects in their territories according to Local Sustainable Development Plans  Planes Locales de Desarrollo Sostenible  PDLS  
10;MARN and MAG coordinate with Non Governmental Organizations  NGOs   international development agencies  and local stakeholders for the implementation of land restoration policies seeking to promote rural development and ecosystems  adaptation to the impacts of climate change 
11;The Government of El Salvador  GoES  is advancing implementation of existing policy instruments  while exploring opportunities to design fiscal policy reforms for a green economy 
12;Implementation builds on extensive experience gained since more than two decades ago through projects supported by the Global Environment Facility  GEF  on environmental management and strategic planning  capacity building on biodiversity conservation and protected areas management  promotion of biodiversity conservation in coffee landscapes and markets for biodiversity  adaptation to climate change  and testing models for integrated management of protected areas  among others 
13;Furthermore  in the 2014 2020 period  El Salvador implemented restauration actions in 241 662 hectares  ha  of degraded lands 37 Most recent actions have been informed by in depth participatory analysis such as  i  a comprehensive assessment of historic trends and causes of deforestation and forest degradation  carried out in preparation for the EN REP design with support from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility  FCPF  REDD  Readiness Preparation Project  P124935    ii  application of the Restoration Opportunity Assessment Methodology  ROAM38  methodology to identify cost effective options for land restoration at national scale  with support from the International Union for Conservation of Nature  IUCN  and other development agencies  and  iii  the development and testing of the Restoration Sustainability index  Indice de Sustentabilidad de la Restauraci n  ISR   with support from the World Resources Institute  WRI  
14;Currently  the GoES is preparing the  0 8 million Project  Fiscal policy reform for a Green Economy and NDC implementation  Restoration and Sustainable Landscape management in El Salvador   with financial support from the International Climate Initiative  IKI39  
15;South Africa s is one of most biodiverse countries in the world  and its biodiversity contributes significantly to the national economy  and to local livelihoods 
16;With a varied geography ranging from plains and savannas to deserts and high mountains  South Africa s ecosystems support over 95 000 species  and its rich biodiversity contributes significantly to the national economy  particularly through nature based tourism 
17;To leverage financial resources and improve capacity to implement the Biodiversity Economy and increase benefits from selected PA landscapes to local communities 
18;The proposed Project Development Objective  PDO  is to restore degraded land in El Imposible   Barra de Santiago Conservation Area
