16,16,Other Decision  as needed       B  Introduction and Context 
17,17,  Country Context    After fourteen years of civil conflict  1989 2003  which destroyed key institutions  infrastructure and the economy   Liberia has made considerable progress in the face of daunting challenges since its return to democratic governance in  2006 
18,17, The return to multi party democracy in 2006 created a favorable environment for long term reconstruction 
19,17, However  in 2014  the twin shocks of the Ebola crisis and the subsequent sharp fall in commodity prices had a severe  negative impact on the Liberian economy  The fiscal impact remains acute 
20,17,The GoL will continue to need exceptional  support from development partners to help with the resulting persistent financing gap 
21,17,Such support will be crucial to  maintain the delivery of key services  including solid waste management  SWM   
22,18,Despite the World Bank s interventions in constructing critical solid waste infrastructure through the Emergency Urban  Sanitation project  EMUS   from 2009 2017  and the ongoing CLUS project  June 2017 to date   waste management  services in Greater Monrovia remain critically underfunded and sporadic 
23,18,About 70  of the population of Greater  Monrovia lives in slums lacking affordable and adequate housing  basic services and critical infrastructure  and secure  land tenure 
24,18,More than half of the population  especially poor households including female headed households  elderly  persons  youth and children are amongst those living in communities with low to no waste collection systems  or living  near poorly evacuated waste management sites  despite the effort made in the recent years by development partners  through the EMUS then the CLUS project 
26,19,  Sectoral and Institutional Context    Solid waste management is recognized as a critical service in the Greater Monrovia area which experiences regular  flooding  due to the accumulation of waste in drains  and rising sea level 
27,19,In addition  poor sanitation and lack of proper  waste management could weaken the country s effort to build resilience to potential infectious diseases after the  devastation wrought by Ebola in 2014 
28,19, Improved in waste management also has the potential to create skilled and  unskilled jobs in the waste and recycling sector and greater levels of social cohesion through engagement and behavior  change around waste issues 
29,19,This outcome aligns well with Liberia s new Pro Poor Agenda for Prosperity and

32,22,Development  PPAPD  which was enacted following the change in government in 2018     
33,23,The majority of the street sweepers and waste pickers are female  and they are generally considered a vulnerable sub  population 
34,23,Most female street sweepers and waste pickers are head of households and are highly vulnerable due to a  lack of alternative livelihood options 
35,23,Despite working in very difficult conditions  female street sweepers and waste  pickers are cash labors who are seldom paid on regular basis due to the limitation in the financial resources faced by  MCC and PCC 
36,23,  This can lead to extortion and sexual exploitation   This leads to income disparities which in turn leads  to increased incidence of social and economic vulnerability of women waste pickers 
37,23,Global evidence suggests informal  female waste pickers often have access to less profitable waste than males and can receive less revenue than males  from selling equivalent quality and quantities of recoverable waste 
38,23,Global evidence also suggests that private sector  contractors are more likely to underpay women than men     
39,24,The CLUS project was designed and approved  in 2017 to support Liberia to build the fundamentals of a solid waste  management system in the Greater Monrovia  Monrovia  Paynesville and surrounding townships  and contribute to the  GoL s Medium Term Economic Growth and Development Strategy  2013 2017  
40,24,At the time f appraisal of the original  project   it was aligned with the World Bank s Country Partnership Strategy for FY 13 16  which included a focus on  public health  disaster risk management  and urban management  as well as the Liberian Agenda for Transformation   AfT  which was the country s development agenda at the time of the project appraisal 
41,24,The AfT prioritized development  of a comprehensive solid waste management strategy and aimed to expand equitable access to environmentally  friendly solid waste management services  especially for the poorest and most vulnerable  while reducing disposal of  solid waste in unmanaged sites 
42,24, The CLUS project contributes to the Objective 8 of the new  Liberia Country Partnership  Franmework  CPF  adopted on October 26  2018 which aims  at supporting Liberia in creating  more resilient urban  environments and rural communities 
43,24, Following the change in government in 2018  a new Pro Poor Agenda for  Prosperity and Development  PPAPD  was enacted 
44,24,The project remains consistent with the PPAPD which aimed  among  other objectives  to improve the institutional  policy and legal constraints barriers to waste management at the national  and local levels 
46,25,The specific objective of the CLUS parent project was to provide improved access to solid waste management  SWM   services in Greater Monrovia through   i  the construction of the Cheesemanburg landfill   ii  the closure of the Whein  Town landfill  and  iii  improvement to existing transfer stations 
47,25,The project is also designed to sustain existing  employment associated with solid waste collection  transportation and disposal  as well as support capacity building  activities for municipal staff of Monrovia and surrounding townships 
49,26,  Original PDO   The development objective of this operation is to support increased access to solid waste management  SWM  services  in Monrovia

59,34,Project Description     The proposed AF will include the restructuring of the parent CLUS project  with respect to   i  the extension of the  closing date to June 2023  taking into consideration the time needed for completion of the physical infrastructure and  supporting the first years of the Cheesemanburg landfill operation   and  ii  changes to the existing institutional  arrangements  strengthening of technical expertise and enhancing monitoring and evaluation support systems for  efficient data collection and metrics for monitoring 
60,34,   The three proposed components and resultant activities under the additional financing will include     Component 1  Construction of the Cheesemanburg Regional Landfill and Closure of the Whein Town Landfill     
61,35,  The construction of the Cheesemanburg Landfill 
62,35, This was originally budgeted at  US 3 5 million  and was  limited to construction of one cell  due to the limited budget at the time of the project design 
63,35,Topographic  surveys of the site  as well as recently completed hydrogeological studies  have shown that the site is hilly  with a high groundwater table  which will result in larger earthworks than initially anticipated 
64,35,With solid  waste generated within the Greater Monrovia area expected to increase  it is critical to design a two cell   landfill and include additional adjacent facilities to reduce waste going to the landfill  e g 
65,35,a larger leachate  collection pond to accommodate the two cells  a composting plant  a recycling platform  a vehicle  maintenance facility  a field office   etc   
66,35,The revised cost estimate for the Cheesemanburg Landfill is around  US US 6 1 million   
67,36,  Transfer Stations 
68,36,Due to limited budget  the original CLUS project planned the minor rehabilitation of the  two existing transfer stations  including activities such as painting  and the rehabilitation of bathrooms etc   
69,36, It has since become clear that additional improvements of the existing transfer stations are needed to  address some of the deficiencies noted during implementation missions  such as the flow of leachate to the  surrounding environment  the need to replace the canopy to prevent blowing debris  and other activities 
70,36,It  is also necessary to start the identification of technical and safeguard studies for an additional transfer  station in the Greater Monrovia area 
71,36,The financing of such a transfer station will be considered for future  additional financing  if available  or through other donors 
72,36,The cost of the site identification  safeguard  studies and technical design will be covered by this project   
73,37,  Additional collection equipment 
74,37,Under the original project  the purchasing of equipment was benefitted  mainly by MCC  and PCC to a lesser extent  as it had no existing waste collection equipment at the beginning  of the project 
75,37,Under the additional financing  the project will purchase more equipment  mainly for PCC   but also MCC   to fully eliminate the high costs incurred with the equipment rental 
76,37,There will also be  provisions to assist the two local governments with capacity building for equipment maintenance 
77,37,Given the  long distance between the Cheesemanburg landfill to the city center  large collection vehicles  tipping  trailers  will need to be acquired for nighttime waste hauling to the Cheesemanburg landfill in order to  ensure cost efficient waste transport 
78,37,The project will also support the purchase of equipment and personal  protective gear for street sweepers  the majority of whom are female   
79,38,  Introduction of a Results based financing for waste management in Greater Monrovia   The Grant from  GPRBA under this AF will support the implementation of an innovative model of a results based financing

82,41, RBF  where service providers  MCC  PCC  CBEs  and other relevant stakeholders  will receive transitional  subsidies to partially support the waste collection and disposal costs 
83,41, This transitional subsidy will support  service quality improvements and will supplement service fee collections in the primary and secondary  collection  provided that the service meets minimum quality standards 
84,41,The subsidy is calculated to gradually  phase out as the cost recovery increases every year 
85,41,Quarterly subsidy allocations to the service providers  from the RBF designated account will be calculated based upon the score achieved through the assessment  of the IVA 
86,41, The IVA will also conduct random  spot checks in the field to assess whether performance data  collected by the M E team represent  real world  performance 
87,41,This report from the IVA for one quarter will  determine how much each beneficiary service provider will be allowed to spend in the next quarter 
88,41, Disbursement from the RBF account for will be subject to World Bank procurement and financial  management regulations  The RBF will be specified in the Manual of Operations   
89,42,  Narrowing gender gap through targeted actions  To narrow the gender gaps described earlier  a set of  activities specifically dedicated to female street sweepers will be supported by the AF 
90,42,This includes   i   providing training to female waste pickers and female street sweepers on Health and Safety and GBV issues   ii  providing free personal protective gear to waste pickers including those designed for women  iii   providing street signage to reduce or eliminate accidents   iv  providing where possible solar powered  lighting at the locations identified as risky areas to protect female street sweepers and waste pickers working  at night against GBV risks  iv  providing dedicated skills development training and coaching to selected  female street sweepers who are willing to improve their livelihood 
92,43,  Enhanced Monitoring Program  The additional financing resources will be used to increase the 
93,44,frequency and number of monitoring points for the groundwater and surface water at the Whein 
94,45,Town landfill and near the transfer stations  A monitoring and evaluation  M E  team will be 
95,46,created at PCC and MCC to support the local governments with daily monitoring of the 
96,47,performance of waste management services in the city  as well as to address grievances and 
97,48,ensure that the waste management sites are kept clean   The M E team will liaise with the 
98,49,safeguard specialist on any environmental and social safeguards issues  Regular reports will be 
99,50,used by the independent verification agent to estimate payments under the RBF Grant 
100,51,mechanism   The development of the M E system will also help leverage female 
101,52,entrepreneurship in developing information technology  IT  tools for M E   
102,53,  Enhanced Communities Support Program  The behavior of communities is a key criterion for 
103,54,success of the project  In addition  the Grievance Redress Mechanism has surfaced complaints 
104,55,and requests during project implementation from communities  in particular  those living near 
105,56,the waste management facilities  During project implementation  small interventions to 
106,57,communities living near waste management sites was effective in building a good relationship 
107,58,and changing behavior  Previous interventions included  for example  distribution of mosquito 
108,59,nets to Whein Town community  provision of waste collection buckets to the Cheesemanburg 
109,60,community  among others   Health programs benefitting waste workers  in particular female 
110,61,workers and people living near the waste management facilities  will also be considered on the 
111,62,case by case basis to enhance the benefit of the project to local communities

114,65,Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  The project will continue to be implemented by the Project Implementation Unit  PIU  within the MCC  and the PIU will  be reinforced with additional positions  such as   i  a Technical Specialist with a strong engineering background to assist  the project coordinator with technical tasks   ii  a Communications Specialist to implement the project s communications  strategy  and  iii  Monitoring and Evaluation Teams within MCC and PCC to report to the PIU  and tasked with collecting  data for the RBF payments and supporting the day to day implementation of project activities 
115,65,   The AF will introduce a Project Steering Committee  PSC  which will oversee the implementation of the project and  necessary high level decisions 
116,65,The PSC will be chaired by the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and will comprise of  representatives from the Ministry of Finance  Ministry of Public Works  the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  of  Liberia  the Monrovia City Corporation  MCC  and the Paynesville City Corporation  PCC  
117,65, The Steering Committee will  provide high level oversight of the implementation and approval of the annual budget prior to the submission to the Bank  for no objection                F 
118,65,Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis  if known    
119,66,The site for construction of the new landfill site is located in Cheesemanburg Township  Montserrado  County 
120,66,The site is an agricultural site but probably had been reserved over the years on shifting cultivation  basis and predominantly covered by secondary vegetation 
121,66,The Po River and the Dima Creek run along the  eastern and southern boundaries of the site  respectively 
122,66,The construction and operation of the landfill may  have minimal negative impact on these water bodies as they are not located within the immediate environs  of the site 
123,66,There are several communities in the surrounding areas of the site but not in the immediate  vicinity of the site to trigger a relocation 
124,66,However  agricultural lands acquired for the construction of the  landfill site will reduce the area of agricultural land available for affected families or households in the area 
125,66, The Stockton Creek and Fiamah transfer stations were built in 2009 in the township of Monrovia  Over time   residence have built in close proximity to these sites  Although the sites are fenced 
126,66,Irregular waste  collection of waste from the transfer sites generates Odor and insects affecting close by residents 
127,66,The  Wheintown landfill is the only Landfill in Greater Monrovia and was identified and developed as an  emergency measure under Emergency Monrovia Urban Sanitation Project  EMUS  in 2006 
128,66,This Landfill  however is reaching its useful life 
129,66,Partial closure activities have commenced but the project had to deal  with pre existing complaints of air pollution due to intermittent fire outbreaks from the landfill site 
130,66,The  original project has financed the construction of a fence and partial capping to reduce and control the fires

135,71,Activities proposed under the AF are not expected to  increase the environmental risks and impacts of the  parent project 
136,71,OP BP 4 01 had been triggered for  the parent project  and the project rated as Category  B 
137,71,The landfill construction will involve several civil  works and waste management activities that have  the potential to adversely impact the biophysical  environment as well as the health and safety of the  public in the surrounding areas and those involved  directly involved with the project activities as  described in the project ESIA 
138,71,Given the nature of  this project  potential adverse impacts may arise  during all stages of the project including  construction  operation and post closure phases 
139,71,A  detailed ESIA which includes a detailed ESMP has  been developed to ensure that all associated  environmental and social impacts are clearly  identified with defined mitigation measures and  monitoring activities provided 
140,71,The ESIA was  provisionally cleared and approved by the Bank and  Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia   respectively  subject to updating and re disclosure  after the completion of a detailed hydrogeological  assessment 
141,71,The hydrogeological assessment has  been completed  and the ESIA is being updated to  include the findings of the hydrogeological  assessment 
142,71,The ESIA will also be updated to include  construction of  a new cell and ancillary facilities   while the ESMPs for the existing transfer stations  will be revised to incorporate the renovation works  proposed under Component 1 of the AF 
143,71,  The existing transfer stations at Fiamah and Stockton  Creek which were constructed under the Emergency  Monrovia Urban Sanitation  EMUS  Project will  continue to be operated under this project 
144,71, Operation of these existing transfer stations and  waste collection points have the potential to  generate adverse environmental and social impacts

146,73,   Feb 11  2020 Page 10 of 17  
147,74,as well as health and safety risks and hazards for the  public and those directly involved in waste  management works  including waste pickers and  transfer station management staff 
148,74,Both transfer  stations have stand alone ESMPs that were  developed under EMUS and disclosed on Info Shop  on March 16  2010  
149,75,The project activities will not have any impacts on  natural habitats  The site has been used for farming  for decades and is predominantly covered by  secondary vegetation 
150,75,No sensitive ecosystems will  be affected by the project  
151,76,The project activities will not involve investment in  forest or protected areas or related forestry  activities that have the potential to adversely   impact forests   or restrict people access to or use of  forest resources 
152,77,Pest Management OP 4 09 No  The project activities do not involve procurement   transportation or storage of pesticides or pesticide  application equipment  
153,78,There are no recognized physical cultural resources  in the project area 
154,78,However  OP BP 4 11 has been  triggered for precautionary reason since the  construction of the landfill includes activities that  involve large excavation activities such as  construction of leachate pond and drainage system   excavation of landfill cells trenches and construction  of access roads 
155,78,The ESIA includes a chance find  procedure that outlines the steps to be followed in  case of chance finds  
156,79,Indigenous Peoples OP BP 4 10 No  This is not applicable to the project area and to  Liberia at large  
157,80,The project has acquired 100 acres of land for the  construction of landfill site and buffer zones in the  township of Cheesemanburg 
158,80,Additional land was  acquired for construction of a 4 km access road to  the proposed landfill site 
159,80, The proposed site is free  from physical relocation or loss of crop as the site is  an agricultural land but probably reserved for some  years now on shifting cultivation basis 
160,80,An  Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan  ARAP  was  prepared and disclosed in country and through  Infoshop in June 2017  Closure of the Wheintown

163,83,will result in loss of livelihood for the current waste  pickers as such the project will prepare a Livelihood  Restoration Plan to address the potential loses  
164,84,Safety of Dams OP BP 4 37 No  Project activities do not involve construction of new  dam or renovation of existing dams  
165,85,No  The project activities will have no impact on  international waterways 
166,86,Projects in Disputed Areas OP BP 7 60 No Project activities are not within disputed areas  
167,87, OPS SAFEGUARD SUMMARY TBL  A  Summary of Key Safeguard Issues    1  Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project 
168,87,Identify and describe any potential  large scale  significant and or irreversible impacts   The AF will finance the scale up of activities under the parent project  enhance community support programs  enhance  project oversight and extend closing date of the parent project 
169,87, These activities will not raise the safeguard category  or trigger any new safeguard risks or policies other than the policies that are already covered in the parent project 
170,87, Construction of  the new landfill will  replace the Whein Town landfill which is the only sanitary landfill in Liberia  and  expected to reach its useful end of life in 2 years 
171,87,The overall environmental and public health impact of this project  will be positive in that it will reduce the amount of solid waste that is not collected and properly disposed of in  Monrovia 
172,87, Any potential adverse environmental and social impacts from construction and  operation of the proposed  Cheesemanburg Landfill as well as the existing transfer stations may relate to  pollution from leachate  gas emissions  from the poorly designed landfill site and overflowing from the transfer stations as well as health and safety risks to  the surrounding communities and workers especially those directly involved in the waste collection and disposal  activities 
173,87,Closure of the existing landfill site will also impact the livelihood of current waste pickers scavanging on the  site 
174,87,The project also has potential to attract migrant workers to seek employment and other procurement related  opportunities 
175,87,Labor and employment issues and risk of Gender Based Violence  GBV  and sexual exploitation  involving workers and local women and girls may also emerge during project implementation     2 
176,87,Describe any potential indirect and or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area   The main source of potential long term impact is the proposed landfill 
177,87,It is expected that the acquired site will be  used for at least 50 years  During operation and post closure phases  the site may not be used for other purposes in  the medium to long term 
178,87,The site will need to be closed  and properly capped and fenced in once the site has reached  its end of useful life 
179,87,Post closure monitoring requirements are provided in the ESIA and will need to be strictly  followed by the MCC to ensure that potential long term impacts are mitigated 
180,87,   Siting a landfill site may also reduce  the land value of area for future sale 
181,87,the project has included rehabilitation of the community feeder road and other  assistance to represent appropriate compensation measure 
182,87,These were identified by the community as main  motivation for the release of land and have been incorporated into the project activities     3 
183,87,Describe any project alternatives  if relevant  considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts 
184,87, The ESIA for the project had considered several options for solid waste management  including the  do nothing   scenario 
185,87,Options explored included landfilling  incineration  sorting and recycling  aerobic and anaerobic digesting and   do nothing  scenario 
186,87,Whilst sorting and recycling diverts a significant portion of the waste stream into useful by 
187,88,The World Bank   Cheesemanburg Landfill and Urban Sanitation project   AF1  P173261  
188,89,   Feb 11  2020 Page 12 of 17  
189,90,products  this option alone does not solve the waste problem  since all the wastes generated cannot be recycled 
190,90,This  option has to be considered in the context of an integrated waste management program with the objective of  reducing the amount of waste to be landfilled 
191,90,Aerobic and anaerobic digesting also require other waste management  options such as recycling  sorting and landfilling in order to be complete and to meet the project objectives 
192,90,Several  sites were also considered in order to minimize the environmental  social and public health impacts of the project 
193,90,The  MCC in 2014 hired a consultant who provided technical support for the selection of the landfill site  Five candidate  sites were considered for the development of the landfill 
194,90,Several criteria  including public acceptance  topography   geology  hydrology  biodiversity  flora and fauna   socio economic impacts  resettlement etc were considered before  settling for the current Cheesemanburg site 
195,90,After considering all these factors  the Cheesemanburg site was found to  be the best site     4  Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues 
196,90,Provide an assessment of borrower  capacity to plan and implement the measures described   Safeguards policies triggered by this project include OP 4 01  OP 4 12 and OP 4 11 
197,90,The MCC hired an independent  environmental consultancy firm to conduct an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment  ESIA  of the project 
198,90,The  ESIA was conducted in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment requirements of the Environmental Protection  and Management Law of Liberia 
199,90,No stand alone document has been developed to address OP 4 11  The OP has been  triggered as matter of precaution 
200,90,Even though there are no recognized physical cultural resources in the project area   some project activities involve large excavation 
201,90,The ESIA thus includes a Chance Find Procedure that outlines steps to  be followed in case of chance finds 
202,90,The project involves the acquisition of land for the development of the landfill and  have prepared an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan  ARAP  in compliance with OP4 12 
203,90,The ARAP and the ESIA  have been disclosed in country and in the Bank s InfoShop  The disclosed ESIA is being updated to incorporate the  findings  of the hydrogeological assessment 
204,90,Stand alone ESMPs for exsiting transfer stations were developed and  disclosed on Info Shop on March 16  2010
