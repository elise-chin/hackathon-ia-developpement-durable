17,16,Moderate  Track II The review did authorize the preparation to  continue 
18,17,1  South Africa s is one of most biodiverse countries in the world  and its biodiversity contributes significantly to  the national economy  and to local livelihoods 
19,17,With a varied geography ranging from plains and savannas to deserts and  high mountains  South Africa s ecosystems support over 95 000 species  and its rich biodiversity contributes significantly  to the national economy  particularly through nature based tourism  NBT  
20,17,The total contribution of Travel and Tourism  to South Africa s gross domestic product  GDP  in 2016 is estimated at 9 3 percent  WTTC   a significant portion of which  is directly linked to natural assets  particularly protected areas  PAs  1 Biodiversity and its habitats also contribute to the  livelihood of the poorest segments of the population  by providing a range of goods  such as food  biomass fuel  and  medicine  and services such as water 
21,17,South Africa s ecological infrastructure2 also increases resilience to climate shocks   by reducing the impact of extreme weather events such as drought and floods  
22,18,2  South Africa has come a long way since 1994 in addressing the historical legacy of exclusion  but its transition  remains incomplete 
23,18,The country s peaceful political transition into democracy is known as one of the most remarkable  in the past century  The economy grew on average 2 79 percent from 1994 to 2018 
24,18,However  given population growth   GDP per capita growth is stagnant or low since 2014 
25,18,Poverty fell from 33 8 percent in 1996 to 16 9 percent by 2008  but  progress slowed in recent years due to structural challenges and weak global growth since the 2008 global financial crisis 
26,18, High unemployment remains a key challenge for the country  standing at 26 7 percent in the last quarter of 2017  The  unemployment rate is even higher among youth  close to 50 percent 
27,18,One of South Africa s biggest challenge is its high  inequality rate  the highest in the world 
28,18,The current government is acutely aware of the challenges that need to be  overcome for accelerating progress and building a more inclusive society 
29,18,It developed a 2030 National Development Plan   NDP   outlining vision and priorities  and the strategic goals of eliminating poverty and reducing inequality by 2030  
30,19,3 
31,19,South Africa s National Development Plan  NDP  2030 demonstrates strong commitment to environmental and  biodiversity protection as a vehicle to address its most crucial development challenge   accelerating growth while  reducing inequality 
32,19,In support of the NDP  the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan  NBSAP  2015 2025  promotes the development of a Biodiversity Economy  to encompass businesses and economic activities that either  directly depend on biodiversity for their core business or that contribute to conservation of biodiversity through their 
33,20,  1 The Kruger National Park  for instance  is also a global tourist destination currently receiving almost 1 9 million visitors per year  making it a  major economic driver in the Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces  providing for a wide range of value chain development opportunities in support 
34,21,of rural development 
35,21, 2 Ecological infrastructure refers to naturally functioning ecosystems that deliver valuable services to people  such as water and climate regulation   soil formation and disaster risk reduction 
36,21,It is the nature based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure and can be just as important for providing 
37,22,services and underpinning socio economic development  Ecological infrastructure includes healthy mountain catchments  rivers  wetlands  coastal 
38,23,dunes  and nodes and corridors of natural habitat  which together form a network of interconnected structural elements in the landscape

41,26,activities  The Biodiversity Economy was identified as a crucial engine for socio environmentally sustainable growth and  poverty reduction  especially in rural areas    
42,27,4 
43,27,South Africa s system of Protected Areas  PAs  covers an area of about almost 100 000 km2 of land area and  over 185 000 km2 of marine area  20 percent of the national terrestrial territory  and 12 percent of the marine territory    and includes both formal PAs and informal Conservation Areas  CAs  
44,27,This vast system of PAs is managed by a range of  national conservation agencies such as South African National Parks  SANParks  and the iSimangaliso Wetland Authority   provincial government  and private and communal structures 
45,27,South Africa harbors world renown protected areas  such  as the Kruger National Park and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park  
46,28,5  South Africa system of PA continues expanding 
47,28,Given the ecological and socio economic relevance of the PA  system  and the fact that the current setup does not allow to sustainably manage biodiversity and ecological processes at  scale  the Government established a National Protected Area Expansion Strategy  NPAES  in 2008 that presents a 20 year  strategy for the expansion of protected areas in South Africa 
48,28,NPAES sets PA targets  provides maps of key areas for PA  expansion  and makes recommendations on mechanisms for PA expansion 
49,28,The three main identified expansion  mechanisms are  i  acquisition of land  ii  contract agreements with private and communal landowners users  developed  through  biodiversity stewardship programmes   and iii  declaration of public or state land  which involves the  reassignment of land to protected area status from another organ of state 
50,28, Contract agreements are viewed as a cost  effective mechanism for government to adequately conserve land identified as threatened ecosystem or high priority for  the achievement of PA targets 
51,28,Biodiversity stewardship programmes can also contribute to land reform and stimulate  rural development  
52,29,6 
53,29,Protected Areas  PAs  have significant potential to contribute to the Biodiversity Economy and serve as local   development hubs  by promoting economic activities in the landscape3 they are embedded in 
54,29,This is specifically true  when considering the tourism sector  in 2016  South Africa received record 10 million tourists   a 12 8 percent increase  from 2015  South African Tourism  2017   and is expected to be among the world s top 20 destinations by 2020 
55,29,Most of  this tourism is based on nature  particularly PAs  South Africa system of PA combined host over 7 million visitors annually   75 percent of which are domestic  with a tendency to increase 
56,29,The Greater Kruger Area alone contributes approximately  USD641m to the national economy through tourism  56 2  of this contribution from the private nature reserves   which  includes over 21 000 jobs 
57,29, The contribution of the Greater Kruger Area to provincial level GRP is USD335m of which 63   is derived from private nature reserves 
58,29,Through nature based tourism  PAs have the potential of contributing to the  economy  and a multiplier impact on the well being of people  especially rural communities living around PAs  through  the creation of jobs  alternative opportunities for local economic development  education and activism for the protection  of the valuable biodiversity of the PA system 
60,30,7 
61,30,However  South Africa PAs are increasingly under threat  resulting in adverse impacts on biodiversity and  ecosystems they harbor  on the rural population dependent on them  and on the broader regional and national  economies 
62,30,Unsustainable and illegal practices on biodiversity  which are among the main causes of loss and degradation  of wildlife  are largely induced by  i  insufficient financing for effective PAs management and to support sustainable rural  development  ii  rural poverty  a lack of access to effective and sustainable livelihoods support  such as jobs  business 
63,31,  3 With the term  PAs landscapes   the project refers to various types of landscapes that lie within and around PAs  encompassing 
64,32,different land uses  from PAs to bordering productive agriculture and forestry areas  to urban settlements  This approach is highly 
65,33,relevant to PAs  as most threats  including population pressure  come from outside their boundaries  This approach also calls for a 
66,34,stronger management present through multi stakeholder coordination platforms that the project will promote  
67,35,  The World Bank   Rural Development for Biodiversity Conservation around Protected Areas  P170213  
68,36,   Feb 06  2019 Page 5 of 14  
69,37,support  direct payments from conservation   and the absence of meaningful livelihood alternatives  and iii  fragmentated   non coordinated  and incompatible land use planning and management  leading to suboptimal land use management  decisions  such as conversions in favor of non conservation friendly activities  such as mining  agriculture  and livestock   among others 
71,38,8  A key threat to the integrity of PAs is poverty  leading to overexploitation of natural resources  including wildlife  crime through poaching and overfishing 
72,38,An estimated 9 12 million people live around PAs  mostly in rural settings  and  face high levels of poverty  and high unemployment rates4 
73,38,A significant proportion of this population also depends on  natural resources for part of their livelihoods 
74,38,With lack of access to public goods  social services  credit  markets  and few  employment opportunities  these rural communities tend to pose threats to PAs  by being involved in poaching   conversion and degradation of natural habitats  and overexploitation of natural resources 
75,38,Wildlife crime specifically has  broader implications on national security  social disruption  weakening of governance and institutional systems and is a  major threat to those PAs who are affected   
76,39,9  The gender gaps in rural communities around PAs represent an additional challenge  According to Statistics 
77,40,South Africa  StatsSA   57 2 percent of women were poor in 2015  somewhat more than men  53 7 percent   Women 
78,41,headed households are particularly affected by poverty  Women seem to be particularly disadvantaged in relation to land 
79,42,ownership  between 2005 and 2010  only 36 percent of the beneficiaries of the land redistribution and tenure program 
80,43,were women  The country has relative gender parity in access to primary and tertiary schooling  In fact  a recent study5 
81,44,notes that more girls finish school and enter institutions of higher learning  However  when examining employment 
82,45,statistics  more men are in wage paying jobs  in high paying jobs and in managerial or decision making positions more so 
83,46,that women  The study also notes that being pregnant or having a baby is one of the main reasons for being out of school 
84,47,among girls aged 15 19  In rural areas  women are more likely than men to be engaged only in non market activities 
85,48, subsistence agriculture   Women are thus more likely than men to be doing unpaid economic work  The rate of gender 
86,49,based violence is high  Addressing the gender gap in rural communities around PAs hold the potential of ensuring greater 
87,50,sustainability of natural resources and granting significant improvements in communities  livelihoods  
88,51,10  Local communities are mostly negatively impacted and realize limited value from living in the periphery of PAs 
89,51, Negative impacts include  but are not limited to  loss of land and competition for land  land rights and tenure issues    economic impacts associated with constraints on non conservation related activities  health impacts associated with the  prevalence of diseases  including higher risk of transmission between livestock  including small ruminants  and wildlife  as  well as zoonotic diseases transmissible to humans  food security and physical security impacts associated human   wildlife  conflict including predation and crop raiding as well as cross border theft  including stock theft   safety and security   economic and social impacts associated with wildlife crime  and associated crime in villages   and  service delivery impacts   in particular in cases where local governments shift resources away from the area due to expectations that PAs can provide  services 
90,51,Many of the communities living around PAs struggle to diversify their existing livelihoods options and find very  limited opportunities  
91,52,11  There is strong and unprecedented momentum in South Africa to promote biodiversity conservation  compatible rural development 
92,52,President Ramaphosa launched in September 2018 the  Biodiversity Economy  Programme   which seeks to balance biodiversity and natural resources protection with sustainable use for economic  development and equitable distribution of benefits 
93,52,The Department of Environmental Affairs  DEA   SANParks  
94,53,  4 As examples  unemployment exceeds ninety percent in some districts around KNP  and more than 50 percent of 3 million local people have no  formal education

99,57,iSimangaliso Wetland Authority and other PAs authorities have taken strategic decisions to prioritize the promotion of  socio economic development of communities around PAs   
100,58,12  A key pillar of the Biodiversity Economy Programme is focused on the development of nature based tourism  a  key contributor to the country s economy and jobs 
101,58,Due to the unique and globally recognized value of biodiversity   nature tourism is one of the most robust sectors in South Africa  making the country a global player in the highly  competitive tourism market 
102,58,Recognizing this  the Biodiversity Economy Programme also acknowledges the potential role  that the sector could play in protecting and enhancing the country s rich biodiversity  while also significantly contributing  to the socio economic development of rural communities through increased participation and awareness 
103,58,As such  there  is a current push for the promotion of more inclusive nature based tourism development around the PA system so that  rural communities historically excluded from commercial opportunities linked to PAs may instead share the benefits of  living round these biodiversity hotspots  may be included in the local socio economic development process deriving from  the sector  and become aware and active stewards of biodiversity conservation 
104,58,As it will be explained in the next sections   the proposed project intends to support South Africa Government s current objectives and efforts  by addressing a specific 
105,59,set of constraints with the potential of enabling aimed at and tangible results   
106,60,Relationship to CPF    13 
107,60,The proposed project is strategically aligned with South Africa s Strategic Country Diagnostic  SCD  prepared by  the World Bank in consultation with the Government of South Africa 
108,60,The SCD explores key development challenges and  opportunities for the country and identifies five binding constraints to tackling poverty and inequality   i  insufficient skills    ii  low competition and low integration in global and regional value chains   iii  limited or expensive spatial connectivity  and under serviced historically disadvantaged settlements  and  iv  climate shocks  the transition to a low carbon  economy and water insecurity 
109,60,The proposed project fits squarely within this framework  by creating the strategic enabling  environment for the following   i  skills enhancement for business development   ii  increased integration into value chains  with potential positive spillovers for local communities   iii  increased and more affordable services for historically  disadvantages settlements  and finally  iv  by increasing resilience and adaptation to climate shocks through climate smart  business practices and enhanced  less vulnerable rural livelihoods 
111,61,14  The proposed project contributes to World Bank s corporate goals and initiatives 
112,61,Specifically  the project aligns  with the following  i  the Global Wildlife Program  a US 131 million global platform led by the World Bank and financed  by the GEF to support wildlife conservation  ii  Climate Change Action Plan 2016 2020 and the Africa Climate Business Plan   ACBP   which aims to raise awareness and accelerate resource mobilization for climate resilient and low carbon initiatives  in Africa  by highlighting on annual basis the initiatives promoted in selected priority areas of intervention  iii  the  Integrated Landscape Management  ILM  approach  which recognizes the value of connected natural resource  management across different land uses at the landscape level as a basis for enhancing people s livelihoods  security and  resilience to climate variability and change  and  iv  WBG Gender Strategy  FY16 23  which seeks to empower women  through four objectives  improving human endowments  removing constraints for more and better jobs  removing barriers  to women s ownership and control of assets  and enhancing women s voice and agency and engaging men and boys 
114,62,15  The project contributes to the World Bank s Maximizing Finance for Development  MFD  approach 
115,62,The  approach intends to guide World Bank s efforts to leverage the private sector for growth and sustainable development   by helping countries reserve scarce public financing for those areas where private sector engagement is not optimal or  available and maximize development resources by drawing on private financing and sustainable private sector solutions  to provide value for money and boost development prospects while meeting the highest environmental  social  and fiscal  responsibility standards 
116,62,The core structure of the proposed project revolves around the ability of being a catalyst for  additional finances and capacities for biodiversity conservation and local economic development around PAs 
117,62,A key 
118,63,  The World Bank   Rural Development for Biodiversity Conservation around Protected Areas  P170213  
119,64,   Feb 06  2019 Page 7 of 14  
120,65,element of this approach is about leveraging sustainable private sector s resources and comparative advantage to support  the biodiversity economy  more specifically by increasing the benefits for local communities by making nature based  tourism more inclusive 
122,66,16  The project responds to the objective of GEF Biodiversity Focal Area 
123,66,GEF s biodiversity strategy to maintain  globally significant biodiversity in landscapes is supported through inclusive conservation and addressing direct drivers of  habitats loss  through improved financial sustainability  effective management  and ecosystem coverage of the protected  area estate 
124,66,The project responds to the Biodiversity Focal Area by meeting two objectives  Objective 1  Mainstream  biodiversity across sectors as well as landscapes and Objective 2   Address direct drivers to protect habitats and species 
125,66, It also contributes to the Aichi 2020 Targets  specifically  Target 1 and 2 under Strategic Goal A  Address the underlying  causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society as the project will raise awareness  within local communities and governments on the value of wildlife by implementing sharing benefits of a biodiversity  based value chain  Component 2  as well as through the establishment of multi stakeholder landscape platforms that will  promote integration of biodiversity values into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies and  processes  Component 1  
126,66,It will also contribute to Targets 5 and 7 under Strategic Goal B  Reduce the direct pressures on  biodiversity and promote sustainable use 
127,66,Through Component 1  the project will support mainstreaming the shared vision  for targeted landscapes which will be based on municipal integrated development plans  local economic development   LED  plans and PA management plans to ensure that biodiversity conservation activities are undertaken 
128,66,The project will  also support mechanisms for PA expansion through the  biodiversity stewardship programme  
129,66,Finally  the project will  contribute to Target 11 and 12 under Strategic Goal C To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems   species and genetic diversity and Target 14 of Strategic Goal D  Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem  services 
130,66,Component 2 of the project will strengthen local communities  capacity and improve community governance to  promote rural development for biodiversity conservation   
131,67,17  The project is expected to be part of the Global Wildlife Program  GWP  Phase II 
132,67,Launched during the GEF 6  replenishment cycle and expected to be expanded in a second phase with GEF 7 financing  the Global Wildlife Program  serves as umbrella to coordinate and share lessons across projects aiming to reduce illegal wildlife trade  IWT  
133,67,According  to the Program s theory of change  IWT will be reduced if  among other things  efforts are placed into empowering  communities in and around PAs to be stewards and beneficiaries of wildlife in its source countries 
134,67,As such  the GWP  promotes the participation and engagement of local communities by increasing the benefits deriving from wildlife  conservation and management  as well as from local economic development through activities such as nature based  tourism 
135,67,Such a mechanism is intended to lower the cost of living near wildlife  while improving livelihoods 
136,67, In full  alignment with the GWB theory of change this proposed project will focus on increasing the benefits that local  communities derive from PAs through a series of activities  including  i  conservation compatible value chains promotion  such as sustainable wildlife tourism  ii  the piloting of a Payment for Ecosystem Services  PES  rewarding resource holders  for adopting sustainable land uses through  conservation agreements   iii  financing  biodiversity stewardship   arrangements  for PAs expansion  and iv  improving PA management  ensuring its socio environmental sustainability and  inclusiveness 
137,67,Increased benefits from PAs will promote improved perceptions about the PAs  and consequently improved  behaviors towards its valuable biodiversity   
138,68,18  Contribution to global benefits  As previously detailed  the current baseline scenario in project areas presents  seriously threatened natural habitats and wildlife 
139,68,Such situation is mainly due to unsustainable and illegal practices   all  of which is largely driven by widespread rural poverty  lack of alternatives  and negative perceptions about PAs by local  stakeholders 
140,68,By strengthening management of PAs and promoting opportunities for PA expansion  Component 1    providing new livelihood opportunities through business development  Component 2   and contributing to a change in  perceptions  Component 1 and 2   the project will help conserve natural habitats and wildlife of global value  while  allowing at the same time these natural assets to realize their economic potential for social development 
141,68,As such  the

144,71,project will deliver a set of globally relevant outcomes  in alignment with the GEF Biodiversity Focal Area  FA  
145,71,In addition   the significant amount of co financing that the project is going to crowd in will ensure coordination of efforts and  leveraged developmental outcomes  kindly see Section H 
146,71,Project Finance for more details    
147,72,19  The project contributes to regional integration by strengthening the management of selected Transfrontier  Conservation Areas  TFCAs  
148,72,TFCAs are areas that cross international borders  managed separately by national authorities  but under a commonly agreed streamlined management plan  with a focus on wildlife conservation 
149,72,The project will  support the Great Limpopo TFCA  Mozambique  South Africa  and Zimbabwe  and the Lubombo TFCA  eSwatini   Mozambique and South Africa   through support to TFCA governance bodies  joint research and law enforcement  and  broader local economy development  Component 1  
151,73,20  Contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation 
152,73,South Africa s carbon dioxide emissions of 510 MtCO2   1 17 percent of global GHG emissions  contributes significantly to the country s ranking as the 14th largest global emitter  and the largest in Africa 
153,73,Climate change is already having an impact on South Africa  and the negative effects on food and  water security  health and livelihoods are disproportionately experienced by the poor  especially women and youth 
154,73, Climate shocks such as marked increase in temperature  changes in precipitation and drought are expected to become  more frequent and extreme 
155,73,This project will strengthen the adaptive capacity and climate change adaptation and  resilience in communities living around selected PA landscapes  primarily through entrepreneurial and business training  in conservation compatible business development 
156,73,Climate smart practices  business development  and value chains  inclusion will contribute to reduce vulnerability to climate change and improve local communities  adaptive capacity   
157,74,21 
158,74,The project will contribute to South Africa s NDP objectives  i  Environmental Sustainability and Resilience  through increased landscapes under protection for biodiversity conservation and investment in rural livelihoods  ii   Economy and Employment through reduced unemployment  broadened ownership of assets and increased GDP  iii  Social  Protection through training and skills development for income support and improved participatory governance and co  management for more transparent benefit sharing with marginal communities  and iv  Inclusive Rural Economy through  sustainable rural economic development  promotion of inclusive businesses and value chains  and multi stakeholder  engagement among strategic partners  Government of South Africa  NGOs  and private sector   beneficiaries and PAs  authorities

169,79,22  The project will put forth a new PA management model  comprising of the following key characteristics   
170,80,  Mobilize new sources of finance 
171,80,The project will leverage new sources of finance to support viable biodiversity  economy businesses to emerge among local communities in PA landscapes  also increasing the benefits deriving  from PAs 
172,80,It will achieve such goal by establishing and capitalizing a Biodiversity Economy Fund  BEF  dedicated to  the above mentioned purposes 
173,80,The project will also consider leveraging existing initiatives created with  compatible objectives  such as the Green Outcome Fund6 and the Tourism Conservation Fund7 
174,80,The project will  also seek potential sources of financing domestically  including from Treasury  national  provincial and local  government departments and agencies  and targeted PAs agencies  budget  consequently contributing to redirect  domestic resources towards socio economic development outcomes 
176,81,  Catalyze public and private sector resources 
177,81,The project will forge strategic partnerships with key stakeholders  from governmental departments  to NGOs and the private sector  helping build the bridge between currently  unrealized but potentially viable business opportunities at the community household level and the private sector   while also fostering the development of market driven  inclusive value chains around PAs landscapes 
178,81,The project  will set up a mechanism to unlock access to finance and markets for businesses in rural landscapes around PAs   by establishing a Launchpad tool which will map private sector operators active in targeted PA landscapes  their  interest in making their value chain more sustainable by partnering with local communities  and their jobs and  services  needs  more details about the Launchpad will be found in Component 2

181,82,  Increase benefits from PAs to local communities 
182,82,The project will put forth a mechanism to significantly increase  benefits to local communities  and consequently contribute to change their attitudes towards PAs and its valuable  biodiversity 
183,82,This mechanism will include   
184,83,i  Support to biodiversity economy businesses  The project will increase benefits from PAs to communities  by setting up a system to help them develop business capacities  linkages with finance and markets  while  also ensuring these businesses are compatible with biodiversity conservation 
185,83,The types of businesses  that the project will promote are mainly the following  i  tourism  hospitality  marketing  tourism  activities  services to the tourism industry  chefs  electricity technicians  etc    ii  game ranching  animal  husbandry  veterinary services  game processing  etc   iii  forest products  commercial forestry  veld and  non timber forest products  iv  agriculture  agronomy  post harvest management  processing and  commercialization  v  business services  IT  consulting  services  software development and

294,167,  Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
295,168,  The proposed project is expected to generate significant environmental and social benefits resulting from a major focus  on restoration and conservation of terrestrial and aquatic ecological process and management of both the Greater St  Lucia Wetlands Park and the Kruger National Park as well as support for a number of local development initiatives   including employment and livelihood generating activities 
296,168,Therefore  the project is not expected to generate significant  and irreversible environmental and social risks and impacts 
297,168,The projects  risks and impacts can be easily mitigated in a  predictable manner  such measures will be included in the Environmental and Social Management Framework  ESMF   and its subsequent Environmental and Social Management Plans  ESMPs  
298,168,    The Project does not involve activities with a potential to harm the population 
299,168,The potential adverse impacts on local  communities will be minor  site specific and few and can be managed with the application of appropriate mitigation  measures 
300,168,Key social concerns are related to  1  labor and working conditions of those engaged in the sub project minor  construction works and those directly engaged by the project to provide technical services  and  2  community health  and safety related to the minor construction works  and  3  the need to consider the potential escalation of conflicts  among stakeholders due to the participatory planning activities
