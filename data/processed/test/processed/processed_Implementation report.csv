18,13,3   Assessment of Development Objective and Design  and of Quality at Entry
19,14,3 1 Original Objective  According to the Staff Appraisal Report  March 1996   the project s initial broad objective was to assist  the Government of Algeria  GOA  in reducing pollution  which was causing health problems and serious  ecological degradation 
20,14,Its specific objectives were to   1  strengthen the institutional and legal framework   and  b  initiate a pilot investment program to mitigate pollution in the industrial sector of Annaba  situated  in the northeastern region of Algeria 
22,15,3 2 Revised Objective  Although the project was revised three times  see section 3 4 below   the original objectives were not  modified 
23,16,3 3 Original Components  Component A  Strengthening of the institutional and legal framework  This consisted of four  subcomponents     The Institution Building Subcomponent  which consisted of activities aimed at  strengthening the 
24,17,technical and administrative capacity of   i  the Haut Commissariat   l Environnement et au  D veloppement Durable  HCEDD  as the cross sectoral forum for environmental policies and its  sub commissions  both of which would oversee and review  inter alia  the National Environmental  Action Plan  NEAP    ii  Direction G n rale de l Environnement  DGE  as the national  environmental agency responsible for national policies  NEAP preparation  proposing legislation   and ensuring operational and technical cooperation   iii  the sector ministries of Industry and  Restructuring  MIR  and Health  MOH  and the National Planning Council  Conseil National de  la Planification  CNP  for assisting in EA and audit preparation in the sectors  preparing health  risk assessment  MOH   and environmental planning  CNP   and  iv  the Inspections de  l Environnement de Wilaya  IEW  in Annaba  Skikda  Constantine  Algiers  and Oran to undertake  monitoring and enforcement activities 
25,17,This subcomponent also included the promotion and  introduction of clean technology 
26,18,  The Enhancement of the Legal and Regulatory Subcomponent which consisted of activities  aimed at providing GOA with the administrative  management  and technical tools to   i  review   update  and modify the most important legal texts and regulations derived from the framework  environmental law and eliminate overlaps and contradictions   ii  apply the modified Environmental  Assessment  EA  decree as an effective policy instrument and develop the appropriate procedures  and sector guidelines   iii  issue and adopt the modified decrees for the classified establishments   including the issuance of environmental permits  training and technical assistance for handling the  transport of hazardous waste  and  iv  undertake a study on environmental liabilities 
28,19,  Design and Implementation of a System for Monitoring and Enforcement Subcomponent  this  subcomponent consisted of the design and implementation of an environment permit system on a  pilot basis in Annaba and Skikda 
29,19,Based on the modified decree on classified establishments  an  environmental permit would be issued after negotiation between the DGE IEW and each  establishment 
30,19,This permit would determine a ceiling on the pollution amount that each  establishment would be allowed to discharge in a given medium by determining local environmental  guidelines  as well as a program  when necessary  for reducing the total pollution load over a  specific time  consistent with the technology used and the financial status of each establishment 
31,19, With this sub component  DGE and the corresponding IEW should be able to monitor the pollution  contracts and test a series of enforcement measures and financial incentives to mitigate pollution in 
32,20,  The National Environmental Fund  NEF  Subcomponent  which aimed at making the NEF  operational and then expand its role into an effective instrument of environmental financing as a  Fonds de D pollution et de Protection de l Environnement  FDEPE  
33,20,This subcomponent would  finance two studies on activating the NEF and establishing the FDEPE and on the development of  economic and financial incentives 
34,20,It was intended to promote the FDEPE into a financial  intermediary that would provide loans and credits from GOA contributions  future Bank loan  proceeds  international donors  and environmental taxes and fees whenever they are legally  established 
36,21,Component B   Pilot Investments Aimed at Mitigating the Adverse Impact of Industrial Pollution in  the Northeast of Algeria   This component covered environmental investments in the Fertilizer Complex  of ASMIDAL and in the Iron and Steel Complex of ENSIDER 
37,21,These two plants were located in the area  of Annaba 
38,22,  The investment in the ASMIDAL complex consisted of   a  dismantling and decontaminating the  sulfuric and phosphoric acid plants of ASMIDAL   b  the provision of phosphoric acid and or  mono ammonium phosphate to compensate for losses in production   c  the rehabilitation of the gas  treatment system in the nitric acid plant and the granulation units used in the fertilizer production    d  the installation of a scrubber or a granulator in the ammonium nitrate plant   e  the  rehabilitation of the harbor reception facility in the port of Annaba   f  the provision of spare parts  and materials for the phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers production lines  and  g  support in the  areas of plant operation and management  and workers  health and safety  standards through  technical and management training 
39,23,  The investment in the ENSIDER Steel Complex consisted of   a  the installation of dust removal  systems for the electric and blast furnaces and sintering plants  and installations of a suitable door  cleaning system in the coke ovens and a boiler for aluminum distillation    b  the provision of  equipment for the construction of two  2  wastewater treatment plants and the renovation of the  existing biological wastewater treatment plant   c  the provision of laboratory equipment to  monitor pollution   d  the provision of spare parts and materials for the plants  and  e  support in  the areas of plant operation and management  and workers  health and safety standards  through  technical and management training 
41,24,3 4 Revised Components  In view of the difficulties resulting from the early institutional instability of the sector  project components  were revised on three different occasions during the first half of the implementation period 
42,24,These changes  were considered necessary to adapt to the rapidly changing institutional and economic environment  while  retaining consistency with the original project objectives 
43,24, However  in spite of the difficulties  this process  ensured that continuity of implementation enabled achieving the project s objective of decreasing  significantly the pollution in one of the most polluted areas in Algeria and in establishing a sound  institutional and legal framework for environmental management 
44,24,In this context  the project became also a  means for engaging GOA in a continuous dialogue that proved to be useful for carrying out the needed  institutional reforms of the sector with the Bank s assistance 
46,25,A first revision took place in November 1998 and was aimed at correcting some aspects of the design of  the pilot investments components  
47,26,ASMIDAL Pilot Investment  the provision of phosphoric acid and ammonium phosphate to  compensate for losses in production was cancelled from the loan and the installation of a  granulator in the ammonium nitrate plant was retained in lieu of the installation of a scrubber 
48,26,  Furthermore  it was also decided to dismantle and cease all operations of the sulfuric and  phosphoric acid plants in lieu of their decontamination   This project revision kept all other  activities 
50,27,ENSIDER Pilot Investment  the project revision eliminated the installation of a dust removal  system for the electric and blast furnaces and sintering plants  and the installation of a suitable  door system in the coke ovens and a boiler for ammonium distillation 
51,27,However  the project opted  instead to install dust removal systems for the coke ovens and blast furnaces  and installation of  equipment for ammonium distillation and desulphurization 
52,27, All other activities were kept      
53,28,The second significant project revision took place in May 2002  It aimed at canceling remaining funds  from the loan for the ASMIDAL and SIDER components at the request of the two companies 
54,28,The two  companies having decided to carry out the agreed environment pollution abatement program using other  sources of funding  ASMIDAL s  financial situation was becoming increasingly more comfortable due to  increase of Ammonia price on the world market  and SIDER was in the process of negotiating a take over  from an international steel manufacturing conglomerate   LNM Steel  
55,28,Taking advantage of the revision of  the project scope  the Ministry of Environment requested re allocating a portion of the cancelled amount for  the implementation of a component that had been pre appraised and which was to be financed by GoA  following agreement made during negotiations 
56,28,This component consisted of establishing a pilot hazardous  waste treatment facility  by financing costs of works  provision of technical assistance  purchase of  collection and treatment equipment  including the preparation of an environmental impact assessment and  relevant technical  economic and engineering studies for the establishment  operation and supervision of the  waste facility 
57,28,As for the components of the pilot investments  they were redefined according to the  activities already completed 
58,28,The activities that had not yet been implemented were to be financed by the  companies themselves  
59,29,The impact of this revision of the project scope on the loan amount and structure was the following  US   41 4 million was cancelled from the loan representing the cost of remaining activities which were part of  component B 
60,29, However  it was agreed that ASMIDAL as well as SIDER  through the newly created  entity  after LNM take over  would stay committed towards the originally planned environmental  investment activities and objectives using their own funds 
61,29, This cancellation left a total of US  36 6  million corresponding to the previously disbursed activities under component B  financed activities under  component A  of which US  10 5 million was allocated for the financing of the hazardous waste  subcomponent 
62,30,As the main mitigating measures for ensuring the sustainability of the project outcomes and the  achievement of the project objectives  performance agreements were established between both ASMIDAL  and SIDER with the Ministry of Environment 
63,30,These performance agreements were implemented as means  to ensure that ASMIDAL FERTIAL and ENSIDER ISPAT would continue to implement industrial  pollution abatement in accordance with their initial commitments to the Project objectives 
64,30, These  performance agreements were essentially a voluntary process through which the Ministry of Environment  could monitor progress in emission reduction in the two companies in return for a commitment to assist  these companies through various ways 
65,30,This approach proved attractive as fairly quickly thereafter about  twenty five companies decided to engage in the same type of agreements with the Ministry of Environment 
66,30,   During the negotiation process leading to these agreements  it was made clear that this approach was not  intended at replacing enforcement action based on the current environmental protection law  but rather to 
67,31,complement the latter in a cost effective manner       
68,32,3 5 Quality at Entry  Quality at entry is rated as satisfactory 
69,32, The project was developed under an interim assistance strategy  of the Bank for Algeria  the 1996 CAS was a one year strategy  which aimed at addressing urgent sectoral  issues considering the political and institutional situation prevailing at the time 
70,32, The project s overall  objective was consistent with the 2003 CAS that identified two main strategic objectives   i  improved  business environment and  ii  public service delivery 
71,32,The project was a catalyst for the delivery of  institutional and sectoral reforms as well as an adequate framework to implement result oriented  environmental management tools on the institutional and operational sides of the sector 
73,33,The project was developed on the basis of a thorough analysis of the sector strategy 
74,33, The technical and  institutional design was based on an institutional and legal assessment of the sector  on a pollution loads  assessment and on health impact assessments 
75,33,These studies indicated that pollution  from public sector  industries on the northeastern coast and located  in particular  in or around the cities of Annaba and Skikda   was a major problem that needed to be urgently addressed  especially given its impact on human health 
76,33, The environmental investments component was considered essential to the project as it had the potential for  demonstrating the necessary link between environmental management and concrete actions on the ground  aimed at reducing industrial pollution 
77,33, Furthermore  these investments proved to be positive test cases and  learning experiences for other similar investments 
78,33,In addition  policy and institutional assessment were  also carried out during project preparation  which led to the approval of a National Environmental Action  Plan  NEAP  for Algeria   
79,34,In retrospect  the initial design of the project may have been overly ambitious as it included groundbreaking  institutional reforms coupled with physical environmental investments  which had never been done in  Algeria 
80,34,Nevertheless  the approach followed did recognize explicitly the risks involved with regard to the  project implementation challenges at a time when Algeria was entering a phase of reforms and when  institutions and government agencies were in a transitional phase 
81,34, Given the project s complex design  it  took GOA some time to build adequate ownership as the institutions in charge of environmental policy and  management were being established at the same time 
82,34,The project environment was further rendered  difficult because of the civil strife situation during the 1990 s that did not allow for strong and consistent  counterpart s commitment 
83,34,Relatively more stable project management conditions were reached only in  2001 with the establishment of a Ministry of Land Use Planning and Environment  MLUPE  which has  been retained through every government changes since then 
84,35,4 1  Outcome achievement of objective  Achievement of DO is rated as satisfactory   Overall  project implementation has resulted in the  achievement of the initial objectives 
85,35, The legal and institutional framework has been significantly improved  and most of the pollution abatement measures were completed under the project 
86,35, Industrial pollution in the  northeast of Algeria has been considerably curtailed 
87,35,Air pollution in the Annaba region has been improved  as emissions have been reduced leading to significant improvement in ambient air quality  as measured for  the most exposed city of El Bouni  by up to 56   for PM10  89  for SO2 and 98  for NOx 
88,35, Health  surveys of respiratory morbidity before and after the project implementation have shown a decrease by  25  and 46  respectively for respiratory illness and for asthma in downtown Annaba 
89,35,The impact is even  greater in the more exposed cities of El Bouni and Sidi Amar which show an improvement on asthma  morbidity rate of  respectively 83  and 78  
90,36,Specific Objectives related to the pilot investments have also been achieved and their outcome is  considered as satisfactory 
91,37,Project Activities carried out by ASMIDAL have resulted in a significant reduction of air emissions as  well as wastewater discharges  These are as follows  
92,38, i  The rehabilitation of the nitric acid plant helped in significantly reducing air emissions  which are  currently under control and are well below accepted norms 
93,38,NOx emissions are below 300mg Nm3 and  dust emissions are at less than 50mg Nm3    ii  The installation of new production process at the ammonium nitrate plant reduced NOx emissions  to less than 150 ppm  ammonia emissions to less 50mg Nm3  and fluorine emissions to less than  5mg Nm3   iii  Wastewater discharge indicators show that suspended solids are less the 30mg l  oxygen load is  less than 120 mg l  fluorine is at less than 20mg l and  ammonia is at less than 10mg l   and   iv  Discontinuation of phosphogypsum discharges in the Bay of Annaba by an amount of 288 000  tons per year 
94,39,Project Activities that were implemented by ENSIDER have also resulted in an important reduction of  its pollution loads  These are as follows 
95,40, i  Dust emissions from the blast furnace and steelworks are presently at less than 50mg Nm3 and  particulate load is less than 0 15 Kg ton   ii  The installation of an ammonia distillation and incineration system helped achieve a reduction of  nitrogen oxide to less than 6 Kg ton of coke output 
96,40,Benzene is at less than 0 1 Kg ton of coke output  and organic compounds are at less than 0 3 Kg ton of coke output and 20 mg Nm3  and  iii  Wastewater discharge indicators reveal that suspended solids are less than 30mg l  oils less  20mg l 
97,41,The effort towards strengthening the legal and institutional framework has resulted in a more  comprehensive regulatory framework and in the establishment of reliable institutional functions and  departments 
98,41,In addition  the project was a catalyst for the implementation of a coherent environmental and  sustainable development policy through the introduction of the concept of integrated pollution control  approach  and for the improvement of the legal basis of the national environmental fund 
99,41,Other  achievements include training and human resource development  the development of a national  environmental knowledge base  the establishment of reference laboratories and air monitoring networks in  the cities of Algiers and Annaba  and the establishment of an environmental information system 
100,42,Although the project had undergone two significant revisions  the achievement of initial objectives has not  been compromised 
101,42,In addition  the substance of the objective that had been initially sought was achieved   and a positive learning experience ensued from project implementation 
102,42,Consequently  even with the  cancellation of US  41 4 million  the project produced positive results and outcomes consistent with the  initial objectives 
103,42, This feature was recognized by the QAG QSA review of the project in 2004 
104,43,4 2  Outputs by components  Component A1  Legal and Institutional Component  Implementation rating  satisfactory 
105,44,Institutional Strengthening Subcomponent  rated satisfactory  Completion of this subcomponent has  resulted in strengthening the institutional capability of MLUPE in key areas of environmental management 
106,45, i  Environmental Regulation Enforcement has been strengthened through the establishment of  reliable institutional functions and departments such as the Environment General Directorate  48 
107,46,regional inspection departments  Inspections de Wilaya  and the establishment  within the  industrial environment policy department of the Ministry  of a unit specialized in the development   implementation and monitoring of more than twenty five  25  environmental management  performance agreements 
108,47, ii  Environmental Policy   The project has also helped in the development of a coherent  environmental and sustainable development policy the preparation of a Sustainable Development  and National Environment Action Plan  NEAP SD   which was formally adopted by the  government 
109,47,Furthermore  it helped strengthen the linkages between the environment and the  economic productive sectors through the creation of fiscal incentives for the disposal of solids and  hazardous waste as well as through the establishment of an Environment and Pollution Abatement  Fund  FEDEP   
110,48, iii  Training and Human Resource Development   363 sector professionals were trained in the  areas of environmental management  
111,49, iv  Development of a National Environmental Knowledge Base   This component strengthened  the expertise of MLUPE and helped in the formulation of sectoral policies such as solid waste  management  environmental accountability and liability  environmental audits of areas at risk   Oued El Harrach Basin  Oued Seybouse Basin  and of industrial plants  Ghazaouet Zinc factory   and several Cement Plants      v  Monitoring capacity  This area was strengthened through the establishment of three  03   Reference Laboratories in Algiers  Oran  and Constantine as well as regional air quality monitoring  networks  SAMASAFIA  in Algiers and Annaba 
112,49, In addition  four  04  wilaya laboratories were  set up for the purposes of monitoring environmental quality  Furthermore  an Environmental  Information System was also established at the MLUPE   
113,50,Completion of this subcomponent has resulted in the strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework  through  i  the adoption of three  03  new laws including an environmental protection law  Law No 3 of  July 19  2003   which clearly restated environmental protection within the framework of sustainable  development  a decree on environmental liability  and a law on solid waste disposal 
114,50, In addition  two  02   decrees were drafted for the classification of all plants and facilities  and for environmental impacts  assessments 
115,50, Furthermore  an industrial pollution control system based on environmental management  performance contracts  EMPA  was implemented  
116,51,  Development of an Integrated Pollution Control System Subcomponent  Completion of this component  was achieved only for the city of Annaba and has resulted in   i  The acquisition and installation of an air  quality monitoring network   ii  The implementation of a permit system needed to determine and monitor  emissions restrictions for polluting facilities  and  iii  The implementation of EMPAs for ASMIDAL and  ENSIDER 
117,52,National Environmental Fund Subcomponent  NEF    The NEF was expanded to include the authority  to finance investments in the areas of environmental cleanup and protection 
118,52, A comprehensive study was  carried in order to determine the ways and means to amend and improve the NEF into a pollution  abatement fund within the national budget process  
119,53,Although this component has not been completed  the likely outcome related to this component is rated  satisfactory   Indeed  detailed studies have been finalized under the project 
120,53, These have been used as a  basis to draft bidding documents for civil works and equipment supply 
121,53, The costs associated with these  activities will be financed by MLUPE GOA s funds and the Bank would continue to provide limited  assistance and advisory services  outside the Loan  for the implementation and completion of the HWM  component 
122,53, Bank s assistance would consist of review of the bidding documents and assistance for the  identification selection of an operator for the Hazardous Waste Management Facility to be located near  Tebessa  in the eastern part of the country 
123,53, The bidding documents for goods and works should be issued  by the end of 2005 and construction will then be financed through already allocated funds from GOA s  budget 
124,54,The outcome related to this component is rated satisfactory despite the cancellation of portion of the  loan initially allocated to the implementation of this component and considering the actualization of the  commitment of the two concerned companies to proceed towards reaching the original project objectives 
125,54, The following results show that the environmental impacts have been substantial as also demonstrated  through the cost benefit analysis presented in annex 3 of this ICR 
126,55,ASMIDAL   FERTIAL  see table 2 annex 3 for project performance indicators   
127,56,ASMIDAL s project activities were put in motion based on technical and environmental audits that had  been previously carried out 
128,56,Activity at the sulfuric acid plant had ended in December 1995  its  decommissioning took place in February 1997  and 9000 t year of SOx emissions was eliminated 
129,56, The  phosphoric acid unit had been closed in December 1995 and 300 000 t year of phosphogypsum waste were  removed permanently 
130,56, Other key project activities included   i  the rehabilitation of the fertilizer plant   which consisted in the installation of dust recovery system   ii  the installation of an ammonia catalytic  reduction system   iii  the installation of a liquid fertilizer production plant whose operations have resulted  in a significant nitrate dust reduction 
131,56, The Project completion has also resulted in the improvement of air  quality in the area where the industrial complex is located and helped foster better public relations for  ASMIDAL 
132,56,Total Project costs were US 20 75 million financed both by the project and by ASMIDAL   see table 2 in annex 2  
133,57,ENSIDER s project activities were able to reduce industrial pollution through the following investments   i   installation of dust removal systems for the electric and blast Furnaces and Sintering Plants and installation  of a door Cleaning System in the coke ovens   ii  installation of an ammonia distillation and incineration  System   iii  installation of WWTP at the rolling mill sites  and  iv  implementation of solid waste  reduction and recycling processes 
134,57, In addition  implementation of a targeted environmental management  measures were carried out in parallel 
135,57, Through the implementation of its environmental management  strategy  ENSIDER has been able to improve the quality of its air and liquid emissions and optimize its  energy use through the recycling of cooling water in various units 
136,57, In addition  ENSIDER achieved a 13   reduction on its energy consumption for the period 2001 2004 and saving 53  on its water use in 2004 
137,57,  The impact of the project has been positive for the environment as well as for ENSIDER s operations 
138,58,4 3  Net Present Value Economic rate of return  Using a dose response model  a cost benefit evaluation of the project s investments is included in Annex 3   table 1  
139,58, The analysis provides an evaluation of the benefits occurring in terms of   i  direct public health  impacts on mortality and on morbidity which takes into account such cases as hospital admissions for  respiratory illnesses  emergency room visits  asthma attacks  other respiratory symptoms  chronic  bronchitis and children respiratory illnesses   ii  indirect impact on limited activity which includes number  of activity days   iii  fertilizer dust recycling by ASMIDAL from increased efficiency of the dust removal  equipment   iv   impacts on the local fishing industry measured in terms of increases in the fish catch in the  bay of Annaba  and  v  impact on real estate values 
140,58, Impacts on air quality and respiratory morbidity are  shown in tables 1 4 in annex 3 
141,59,An interesting characteristic of this project is that the benefits started to accrue when companies  and in  particular the company ASMIDAL  started to take measures such as the decommissioning of the Sulfuric  Acid and Phosphoric acid plants in 1995  in agreement with their commitments to the objectives of the  project 
142,59, This point underscores the importance and efficiency of measures based on rigorous and inclusive  economic analysis that led to a beneficial solution both from the environmental and financial point of views 
144,60,Finally the analysis shows that during the period covered by the analysis  for each dollar invested in the  project by all stakeholders  nearly US 6 00  benefit to cost ratio  were generated as direct benefits or as  avoided costs 
145,60,This corresponds to a net present value of US 294 million and US 43 million  at 6   discount rate  this relatively low discount rate to reflect the important public good and environmental  dimension of these costs and benefits   respectively for the total indirect and direct benefits and in the case  where only the health benefits are taken into consideration 
146,60, At 10  discount rate these figures are   respectively  US 246 million and US 31 million 
147,61,4 4  Financial rate of return  As an environmental project  a financial rate of return was not calculated in the SAR and therefore is not  included in the ICR 
148,61, Although it has not been calculated explicitly  the project has demonstrated in the case  of the two target companies  and especially ASMIDAL  that sound environmental objectives could be  consistent and actually reinforce the development strategy of the company 
150,62,4 5  Institutional development impact  This outcome is rated substantial  The Ministry of Land Use Planning and Environment   MLUPE  was  the main beneficiary of the institutional strengthening component of the project 
151,62,The project allowed  MLUPE to strengthen its operational capacity in key areas 
152,63,  On the regulatory side  the project generated important guidance on the draft EIA decree that will  be approved by the government in 2005 2006 
153,63, Approval and implementation of this decree will  provide a major alignment with the new environmental protection law enacted in 2003 
154,63, In addition   the MLUPE has taken steps to extend the air quality monitoring networks to two other major cities  of Skikda and Oran considering the success of the networks installed in Algiers and Annaba 
155,63, The  monitoring networks of Skikda and Oran will be financed by the budget of MLUPE 
156,63, Furthermore  legal provisions have been included in the 2005 budget law and have been prepared to be submitted  to the government 
157,63, These proposed changes will allow the proper use of the environment and  pollution abatement fund  FEDEP  as a financial intermediary that will be able to provide financial  incentives for industrial pollution abatement activities 
158,63, The MLUPE has built confidence through  the IPC project and is now developing a similar industrial pollution abatement project in  Ghazaouet in the western part of the country 
159,64,  At the local level  the environment inspectorates have been strengthened and able to play a  significant role in the local development policy  
160,65,  A training program has been implemented and completed as part of the Technical Assistance  component of the project and has helped to improve the expertise of professionals dealing with  environmental management and natural resources protection 
162,66,5 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency  During the 1990 s decade  Algeria had been experiencing a period of political instability that affected the  institutional sphere and  in consequence  impacted negatively the implementation of most Bank financed  project 
163,66, Governmental policies were short lived because of political changes and only in 2001 the first  signs of recovery and stability started to appear   
164,67,5 2 Factors generally subject to government control  It is considered that because of the factors mentioned in the previous paragraph  the government did not  provide adequate project ownership during the first half of the project implementation period 
165,67, Project  implementation suffered greatly from the successive institutional changes that occurred in the sector 
166,67, These  changes undermined the work of the project implementation unit  which itself was subject to several  changes 
167,67, This resulted in delays in procurement for the three components and caused disbursements to lag  behind the initial schedule 
168,67, In addition  ENSIDER  a public enterprise at the time of project effectiveness   delayed implementation of all projects activities due to financial difficulties   
169,68,5 3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control  The Borrower had great difficulty in adhering to Bank procurement procedures 
170,68, This resulted in lengthy  approval procedures within the national public procurement system and consequently slowed the  implementation of contracts for the pilot investment projects as well as for the institutional strengthening  component 
171,68, However  the main cause for this situation is more systemic to Algeria rather that specific to  the particular implementing agencies involved in the project 
172,69,5 4 Costs and financing  The second loan amendment led to the cancellation of US 41 4 millions from the loan leaving US 11 6  million for ASMIDAL  US 4 0 million for ENSIDER  corresponding in the case of these two companies to  disbursements already made or to payments committed  and US 21 0 million for the institutional and legal  component of MLUPE  US 10 5 for the original institutional strengthening component and US 10 5  million for the new Hazardous Waste Treatment Plant component  
173,69, The cancellation of a major share of  the loan did not affect significantly the implementation of the physical component of the project as the  companies decided to finance the remaining activities using their own resources 
174,69, The project amount  actually totaled US 36 4 million of which US 23 4 million were effectively disbursed which is 64  of the  amended amount or 30  of the initial amount  see tables 1 2 in annex 2  
175,70,6 1 Rationale for sustainability rating  This ICR rates the sustainability of the project as likely 
176,70, The policy framework and components put in  place by the project and current GOA initiatives will ensure the sustainability of project outputs in the area  of industrial pollution control and Environmental Policy Management 
177,70, The project has strengthened the  institutional and legal capacity within the environmental management framework   Key to the sustainability 
178,71,aspect are the environmental management performance agreements  which have resulted in strengthening  compliance with environmental regulations in other sub sectors of industry as industrial enterprises  operators and investors are including environmental management into their activities as well as a significant  improvement in monitoring and enforcement capabilities 
179,71, The key accomplishments in this regard are   i  a  strengthened environmental regulatory framework   ii  the development by the Government of a coherent  environmental and sustainable development policy as well as a vital environmental program resulting from  the preparation of a Sustainable Development and National Environment Action Plan   iii  the  establishment of a National Environmental Fund  this fund was expanded to include the possibility of  financing pollution abatement investments   iv  the implementation of a critical training program that  should continue to strengthen and expand human resources capabilities in the areas of environmental  management   v  the creation of a national environmental knowledge base that should provide a significant  analytical framework for local professionals working in the areas of environmental management  solid  and  hazardous waste disposal  environmental economics  and clean technologies  and  vi  the establishment of  monitoring capabilities at different level of the environmental administration and in particular the  establishment of air quality monitoring networks and environmental laboratories 
180,72,6 2 Transition arrangement to regular operations  Most of the investment projects leading to pollution abatement have been completed and commissioned by  ENSIDER and ASMIDAL 
181,72, These two companies have internalized good management practice   established environmental units and signed with the ministry of environment voluntary environmental  performance agreements 
182,72, These steps certainly helped the two companies negotiate successfully their  privatization process  by increasing their goodwill and decreasing the perceived risk of environmental  liabilities due to past pollution 
183,72, It is also important to underscore that following the implementation of this  project  the companies adopted a more open communication policy towards the public and even organized  open doorevents 
184,73,Bank 7 1 Lending  Project preparation and appraisal are assessed as satisfactory 
185,73, Formal appraisal took place in May  1995 and the Bank did allocate adequate resources for project preparation and for its assistance to the  Borrower in undertaking studies needed for the project 
186,73,The overall risks of the projects were considered  high at the time of project preparation but the investment component of the project and later the hazardous  waste component were viewed as high risk but high rewards activities 
188,74,7 2 Supervision  Project supervision is assessed as satisfactory The project was supervised in a complex country  environment characterized by institutional instability and security problems 
189,74,However  despite frequent  changes in the counterpart decision makers during the initial stages of the project  the Bank team carried its  supervision of the project with commitment and was able to sustain continued sector dialogue that enabled  project revision in May of 2002 
190,74, Continuity of supervision quality was ensured as Bank staff showed  flexibility and understanding in responding to evolving circumstances 
191,74,Considerable supervision efforts  were given to the implementation of the hazardous waste management component as progress was slow and  implementation issues of the component required thorough attention to technical details 
192,74,Overall  Bank  teams were well staffed with a good skill mix  Management and staff maintained strong continuity in the  dialogue with the counterpart 
193,74, The PIU and the Bank team worked in tandem to ensure that progress in  implementation was achieved 
194,74,Concrete progress had been made by July 2004 contributing to the  establishment of a stronger institutional and legal framework for environmental management 
195,74,A QAG QSA  review in October 2004 reached a similar conclusion regarding the supervision performance of the 
196,75,7 3 Overall Bank performance  Taking into account all of the above  the Bank s overall performance is assessed to have been  satisfactory 
197,76,Borrower 7 4 Preparation  Satisfactory   Project objectives reflected GOA s commitment in strengthening its institutional capacity 
198,76,  Sector s institutions were genuinely interested in developing a productive dialogue with the Bank 
199,76, The  government committed to take unpopular actions in the case of the company ASMIDAL as required by the  project 
200,76, Two of the plants constituting the fertilizer complex of ASMIDAL in Annaba were closed   One  was dismantled and the other retrofitted for the production of less polluting compound 
201,77,7 5 Government implementation performance  Satisfactory 
202,77, As mentioned earlier  the political volatility that plagued the country during the 1990 s led to  institutional instability that was detrimental to the project during the early years of the project 
203,77, However   by 2001  the Ministry of Land Use Planning and Environment was established and played an effective role  in revitalizing the project 
204,77, The Ministry of Finance played also a catalytic role in ensuring that the most  pressing issues were dealt with diligently but the inability to support the implementing agencies in applying  the fiduciary requirements of the World Bank remained an impediment during the life of the project 
205,77, The  adoption by the government of several measures and regulations resulting directly from the project activity  was a strong sign of government commitment and should be appreciated as such   
206,78,7 6 Implementing Agency  Satisfactory 
207,78, Despite project implementation delays due to an array of different causes outside its direct  control  the implementation agencies  ASMIDAL  SIDER and MLUPE DGE  performed adequately 
208,78, For  instance  by mid term review  stability in the main implementation entity  MLUPE DGE  counterpart team  was regained and allowed an improvement in implementation performance 
209,78, However  difficulty to  understand World Bank procurement process remained a significant hurdle  
210,79,7 7 Overall Borrower performance  Taking into account all of the above  the Borrower s overall performance is assessed to have been  satisfactory 
211,80,8 1 General lessons from project design and implementation in the particular area of industrial  pollution control
212,81,Implementation of the hazardous waste component  The project was right in adopting a careful  approach in the implementation of the hazardous waste treatment facility in properly requesting an  EIA as soon as it appeared that the original site considered during project preparation was no  longer available 
213,81, Then feasibility studies and market assessments were necessary to assess the  financial viability of the project as well as the attractiveness of the project to the private sector 
214,81,  The lesson learned is that the quality of preparation has here led the client to continue the project  using its own resources thus ensuring the sustainability of the action started under the project 
216,82,Project ownership by the Borrower  Numerous institutional and administrative changes  undermined responsibility and accountability for project implementation   Weak project ownership 
217,83,affected project implementation from 1997 to 2001 in terms of commitment to disbursement   compliance with the procurement schedule  and adherence to loan covenants 
218,83, However   consistency in the dialogue finally bore fruits after institutional stability was regained in  2001 2002  
219,84,8 2 Specific lessons for future projects in Algeria in the environmental area
220,85,Industry s attitude towards environmental management policy  Project s implementation has  resulted in shaping industry responses to environmental policy incentives and stronger enforcement 
221,85,  This is illustrated by the signing of more than 25 voluntary environmental performance agreements  by other industrial operators 
222,85, Furthermore  it shows that industry is willing to be more proactive in  dealing with pollution abatement 
223,86,Environmental Pollution Abatement Fund  FEDEP   This fund requires further improvements in  terms of its governance  financial capacity  financing mechanism and environmental cleanup  strategy 
224,86, However  it has the potential of being a cornerstone for the sustainable financing of  environmental investments  provided further attention is paid to overcoming regulatory and  institutional barriers preventing its upgrading 
225,86,FEDEP s main role focuses on two areas of  environmental management  one is related to the issue of the environmental liability for past  pollution and the other is related to the promotion of cleaner technologies 
227,87,ASMIDAL and ENSIDER Pilot Projects  These two projects proved to be catalysts for the  project impacts as they resulted in concrete reduction in industrial pollution and proved to be  encouraging test cases for the implementation of environmental management tools such as the  environment performances agreements and integrated pollution control approaches 
228,87, They provide  a learning experience that should be used as reference for future projects 
229,88,The borrower  represented by the Ministry of Land Use Planning and Environment  has reviewed the  Bank s ICR and found it appropriate  This feedback was provided by email on December 24  2005 
230,89,The borrower has prepared its completion report  a summary of which is appended in Annex 8 of this ICR

298,145,Le projet   Contr le de la Pollution Industrielle    CPI   tr s g n rique dans sa conception  de base et apr s adaptation aux besoins r els  a su r pondre dans les d lais impartis    l objectif ambitieux fix  au d part   parfois m me  il est all  au del  des programmes  pr visionnels pour pouvoir r pondre   des besoins et des attentes non programm s mais  dont la r alisation  tait indispensable   la poursuite du projet 
299,146,Il est caract ris  par 5 blocs compos s chacun de diff rents activit s  
300,147,Suite   l identification et   l  valuation des besoins n cessaires pour la mise   niveau  professionnelle et institutionnelle de la gestion des d chets sp ciaux et de la protection de  l environnement  le projet a proc d    des actions prioritaires par le renforcement des capacit s  institutionnelles  administratives et juridiques de l administration et des acteurs dans le domaine de  l environnement ainsi que par des actions d anticipation et de pr caution environnementale  comme les pr  diagnostics environnementaux et  l introduction  de la dimension  conomique  dans les analyses environnementales 
301,148,Dans le cadre de la mise en place d instruments institutionnels de gestion  cologique  le projet a  assur  la formation environnementale dans les domaines des d chets industriels  de l eau  de l air   de l assainissement et des pollutions   l intention notamment des cadres du Minist re et de ses  partenaires ainsi que des entreprises 
302,148,Ces actions ont pu  tre r alis es gr ce   la mise en place du  Centre National des Formations   l Environnement  CNFE   
303,149,En favorisant la cr ation du CNFE  le projet CPI  a su r aliser un cadre et des conditions de  travail optimal pour une formation ad quate dans tous les domaines de l environnement 
304,149,Gr ce    son statut   commercial    le CNFE peut garantir une formation ad quate et p renne   tous les  secteurs concern s et int ress s par l am lioration des ressources humaines en savoir faire  environnemental 
305,149,La structure peut aussi assurer un suivi p dagogique des stagiaires pour  accro tre l efficacit  des formations dispens es  Un travail de marketing continu est ind niable
306,150,Le Minist re de l Am nagement du Territoire et de l Environnement  par le biais du  Conservatoire National de Formation   l Environnement devrait orienter sa strat gie de formation  en collaboration avec les minist res charg s de l  ducation et de la formation professionnelle vers  des formations dipl mantes  formations qualifiantes et formations de formateur 
307,150,Cette d marche  constitue la base pour l identification des profils et types de m tiers de l environnement  la mise en 
308,151,place de formations et le d ploiement progressif des m tiers de l environnement en Alg rie 
309,152,Par ailleurs  le projet a efficacement contribu    la mise en place d un syst me d information par la  mise oeuvre d un syst me d information au niveau de la DPEI reli    toutes les Directions de  l environnement au niveau national 
310,152,Cet acquit donne une assise tr s solide pour  largir dans les  meilleures conditions ce syst me  
311,153,Un syst me National de l Information Environnementale  SNIE  est une n cessit   tant donn   que l ONEDD est une organisation o  l information est capitale 
312,153,L efficacit  de l ONEDD  d pendra donc directement de l efficacit  de son   Syst me d Information     la mise en place  d un tel syst me au niveau national est un objectif ambitieux qui requiert des ressources  humaines comp tentes ainsi que des moyens  mat riels et financiers mais et surtout au vu de la  situation dans ce domaine en Alg rie une mise en place d un SNIE efficace et fiable exige du  temps 
313,154,En ce qui concerne la mise en  uvre d une gestion int gr e pour la r duction de la pollution   l ONEDD  avec l assistance d une expertise externe  pourrait donner suite aux travaux pr paratifs  effectu s dans le cadre du projet et proc der imm diatement   son application par un test aupr s  des structures industrielles pilotes FERTIAL et ISPAT d j  sensibilis es par le projet pour une  telle action 
314,155,Ainsi le CPI a contribu    l installation des structures appel es   suivre   l avenir  d une part  les  instruments de surveillance comme l auto contr le des rejets et l auto surveillance des  installations de d pollution et  d autre part  les instruments techniques de gestion  cologiques  comme les CET et l introduction des technologies plus propres ces deux instruments  institutionnels doivent dans l avenir fournir les bases techniques d une r glementation  volutive en  harmonie avec le d veloppement  conomique et social du pays  
316,156,Toutes les activit s concernant l  laboration d une strat gie et de la mise en place du CNTPP ont   t  r ussies 
317,156,Le CNTPP a  t  cr   et repose sur une base juridique et institutionnelle fiable et  durable 
318,156,Par ailleurs le projet a r alis  avec succ s le premier cadastre des d chets sp ciaux en  Alg rie lequel a permis de concr tiser un Plan National de Gestion des D chets Sp ciaux   PNAGDES  englobant une strat gie et un plan de mise en  uvre des infrastructures et de la  logistique n cessaires pour proc der   des actions de d pollution de grande envergure au niveau  national 
320,157,Suite   cela un mod le de gestion int gr e pour la r duction de la pollution a  t  d velopp   r pondant aux besoins complexes d un tel syst me 
321,157,Ce mod le a  t  discut  avec les repr sentants  de deux complexes industriels pilotes et a  t  am lior  en cons quence 
322,157,La mise en  uvre  pratique d un  mod le de d pollution aussi complexe et qui touche   tous les niveaux   administratif  r glementaire et technique  de la concertation et de l int gration des efforts de  d pollution requiert  un temps qui n  tait plus disponible dans sa totalit  pour le projet 
323,157,Cependant  les pr paratifs d une gestion int gr e sont de telle sorte r ussies et les unit s pilotes sont  sensibilis es qu il est possible au CNTPP de passer imm diatement au test pratique de ce mod le 
324,158,Finalement un mod le de gestion int gr e  prenant en consid ration les instruments et expertises  r alis s dans le cadre du projet  a  t   labor  
325,158,La demande d autorisation d exploitation  les  instruments d am lioration de la d pollution par le biais des Meilleures Techniques Disponibles   MTD  ainsi que l utilisation d un logiciel d aide   la d cision dans le but de la d pollution   DSS IPC  sont les  l ments cl s de cette m thodologie 
326,159,Ces  l ments du mod le ont  t  pr sent s et discut s avec les responsables de l environnement  des complexes industriels ISPAT et FERTIAL et pourraient  tre appliqu s au niveau de ces deux  structures industrielles lorsque des objectifs de qualit  des milieux  r alistes  auront  t  coopt s  avec l accord des diff rents acteurs  collectivit   population et industriels  et  les  ch anciers ainsi  que les m canismes de financement de leur mise en  uvre auront  t  arr t s 
327,160,Le projet a par ailleurs contribu    l  laboration des instruments  conomiques et financiers  de gestion  cologique comme le fonds pour l environnement et la d pollution  FEDEP  et la  fiscalit   cologique 
328,160,Le projet CPI a particip    l instauration des contrats de performance  environnementale qui est une premi re d marche vers l int gration du d veloppement durable  dans la politique des entreprises 
329,160,Les entreprises signataires des contrats de performance  s engagent   financer les investissements n cessaires pour la d pollution et sont en contrepartie  accompagn es par les services techniques du MATE et peuvent acc der au FEDEP pour des  actions bien d termin es 
330,161,Le projet CPI a r alis  une  tude sur la responsabilit  environnementale et a pr par   dans le  cadre de la fiscalit   une r glementation en vue de la pr vention et de la prise en charge des  dommages environnementaux 
332,162,L  tude a port  particuli rement sur les dispositions relatives   la r pression administrative  sur les  r gimes de responsabilit  civile et de responsabilit  p nale  y compris les dispositions relatives    l assurance ou d autres garanties financi res intervenant en mati re de responsabilit   environnementale 
334,163,La responsabilit  environnementale en tant qu instrument de politique de l environnement r unit  et conjugue deux moyens d actions sp cifiques      1  le transfert en amont de la responsabilit    mat rielle et ou  conomique   totale ou partielle   de la collectivit  vers les producteurs   et  2  la  cr ation d incitations en faveur de la prise en compte des aspects environnementaux par les  producteurs dan le cadre de la conception des produits   
336,164,L  tude recommande deux champs d action prioritaires    savoir l adoption des textes  d application pr vus par la loi et le renforcement des pr rogatives et des moyens des Directions de  l environnement de wilaya pour la recherche et la constatation des infractions 
337,164,Mener   bien les  chantiers de r forme juridique dans ces domaines permettrait  avec un nombre limit  de mesures   d am liorer de fa on significative l efficacit  pratique des dispositifs juridiques relatifs   la  responsabilit  environnementale 
338,165,La responsabilit   largie des producteurs  est reli e   la fiscalit   cologique  introduite par les 
339,166,diff rentes lois de finances depuis 2002  Elle accompagne sp cifiquement cette derni re au niveau  de produits  de groupes de produits et ou de flux particuliers de d chets
340,167,Le projet a  par ailleurs  particip    l installation d une fiscalit   cologique pour l Alg rie et de ce  fait   l instauration des premi res taxes  cologiques 
341,167,La fiscalit   cologique a un impact de    r forme   budg taire permettant de mieux r partir le poids de la d pense environnementale entre   d une part  les contribuables et  d autre part  ceux qui sont   l origine d une d gradation de  l environnement 
342,168,Les cat gories suivantes de taxes concernant l industrie ont  t  consolid es   largies ou institu es    la faveur de la Loi de finances pour 2002 
343,169,Taxe forfaitaire affect e   Taxe sur les activit s polluantes ou dangereuses pour  l environnement 
344,170,Taxes  cologiques d orientation     Taxe d incitation au   destockage   des d chets industriels   taxe d incitation sur les d chets li s aux activit s de soins  taxe compl mentaire sur la pollution  atmosph rique d origine industrielle 
346,171,Compte tenu des co ts des dommages port s   l environnement  environ 6  du PIB sans  l environnement global  et des co ts de rem diation pressentis  quelque 3  du PIB   les actions  de court et moyen terme  les investissements d cennaux comme les mesures institutionnelles vont  exercer un fort impact sur le budget de l  tat 
347,171,En particulier  les investissements vont non  seulement tendre   alourdir la d pense publique de protection de l environnement au d marrage  des programmes  mais vont  galement impliquer des engagements pluriannuels pour la  maintenance et le renouvellement des  quipements 
349,172,Pourtant  ces augmentations de la d pense en faveur de l environnement ne signifient pas que la  d pense publique alg rienne doive augmenter d autant dans la mesure o  c est pr cis ment le r le  de la fiscalit   cologique que d offrir un relais   la d pense publique en permettant de rapprocher  la d pense de celui qui en est   l origine  d o  le principe du pollueur   payeur 
350,173,Dans le cadre de la privatisation des entreprises  ni l  valuation du co t de la pollution  industrielle  ni celle des co ts de rem diation ne font partie de l  valuation de leur actif net 
351,173, L  valuation financi re de base d une installation doit par cons quent  tre compl t e d une   valuation  conomico  cologique des co ts li s   une rem diation environnementale 
352,174,Il s agit d inscrire ce passif environnemental dans l  tablissement de l actif patrimonial net des  entreprises industrielles concurrentielles de mani re   consolider ce dernier au sens d un actif qui  soit  pur  d un point de vue   la fois financier   conomico social et  cologique 
353,175,L  tude conduite par le projet a permis d  tablir la proc dure de prise en compte du passif  environnemental des entreprises industrielles alg rienne dans la proc dure nationale de  privatisation 
354,175,Le processus de privatisation est tout d abord pr sent  ensemble avec la question  environnementale  Puis la proc dure de saisie du passif environnemental d une unit  industrielle 
355,176,ou d un secteur est d velopp e par  tapes jusqu   l inscription d une part environnementale dans  l affectation du produit de cession 
356,176,La m thodologie permettant d appr cier le passif  environnemental   prendre en compte est connue du fait qu elle a d j   t  appliqu e dans le  secteur du ciment en Alg rie  
357,177,Le   service   de ce type d  valuation pourrait  tre confi  au FEDEP au niveau de son comit  des  risques  cologiques industriels
358,178,L article 189 de la loi des finances pour 1992  modifi  et compl t  par l article 30  de la loi des  finances compl mentaire pour 2001 avait cr   le compte d affectation sp ciale n  302 065  intitul     Fonds National pour l Environnement et la D pollution    par abr viation FEDEP  pour  d velopper des d marches permettant de soutenir les actions de d pollution et r duire les  pressions exerc es sur le milieu naturel 
359,179,L objectif du Fonds consiste    travers des mesures incitatives    encourager les industriels    investir dans la d pollution 
360,179,Le concours du Fonds est ouvert aux projets de d pollution sur la  base de crit res d  ligibilit  clairement  tablis 
361,179,Cette approche vise particuli rement   encourager  l acquisition de technologies de production plus propre 
362,180,La gestion technique des projets de d pollution et de protection de l environnement a n cessit   des r am nagements juridiques qui portent aussi bien sur des modifications de dispositions    caract re l gislatif ou r glementaire que sur la mise en place d instrument adapt  aux proc dures  de gestion technique et financi re 
364,181,Dans ce contexte le projet a conduit une  tude compos e de deux volets essentiels  
365,182,Le premier a port  sur l instrumentation juridique  notamment les dispositions l gislatives et  r glementaires qui constituent des pr alables pour la mise en  uvre du FEDEP et son  fonctionnement efficient 
366,183,Le second volet a trait aux modalit s techniques  aux proc dures et aux t ches des diff rents  partenaires qui interviennent  dans le cadre du fonctionnement du FEDEP  
367,184,Par ailleurs des expertises ont permis de d finir pr cis ment les proc dures pour la mise en   uvre d un projet de d pollution ainsi que les crit res d  ligibilit  au Fonds de d pollution 
368,185,Le projet a  t  accompagn  de mesures   la fois l gislatives  institutionnelles et  conomiques de  nature   approfondir et enraciner les r sultats obtenus 
369,185,Notamment les actions suivantes sont de  nature   garantir la p rennit  des r sultats du projet 
370,186,Actions du Minist re de l Am nagement du Territoire et de l Environnement 
371,187,  Promulgation d une nouvelle loi sur la protection de l environnement dans le cadre du 
372,188,d veloppement durable   Promulgation d une nouvelle loi sur la gestion des d chets   Promulgation d une loi sur les risques majeurs o  l aspect risques industriels et   nerg tiques est pris en consid ration   Introduction d instruments  conomiques   travers diff rentes lois de finances pour inciter  les acteurs  conomiques   un comportement plus responsable vis   vis de l environnement   Mise en place de r seaux de mesure de la qualit  de l air   Annaba et Alger   Mise en place de laboratoires et de station de surveillance des milieux   Cr ation d agences charg es de catalyser le d veloppement d aspects importants de la  gestion de l environnement 
373,188,  Pr paration et signature avec plusieurs entreprises industrielles de contrats de performance  environnementale
374,189,  Financement sur ses propres ressources d investissements   caract re environnemental  ex    unit  nitrate d ammonium    Mise en place d un r seau de mesure des  missions polluantes   Mise en place d une politique de communication relative   ses initiatives  environnementales   Mesures pr liminaires pour la mise en place d un syst me de gestion environnementale   Mise en place d un d l gu    l environnement charg  du suivi de la situation  environnementale du complexe 
375,190,  Programmation de ressources financi res pour la r alisation d investissements  environnementaux 
376,190,  Mise en place d un d l gu    l environnement charg  du suivi de la situation  environnementale du complexe 
377,191,Toutes les activit s ont  t  r alis es  Ces activit s ont permis de concr tiser l objectif assign  
378,192,Au del  des r sultats physiques le CPI a permis  galement  par l apport d une expertise  internationale de haut rang  permettant aux op rateurs alg riens de se mettre au niveau de  l  co technologie moderne mise en  uvre dans les pays avanc s 
379,193,Le projet CPI a permis de cristalliser les efforts du Gouvernement alg rien en mati re de lutte  contre la pollution industrielle 
380,193,Ce projet a suscit  une prise de  conscience de la part des autorit s  et  la n cessit  d  largir les instruments   m me de limiter les nuisances dues   la pollution  industrielle en est la preuve 
381,193,Ces approches concernent les instruments r glementaires classiques  bas s sur la limitation des  missions et leur contr le  les instruments  conomiques bas s sur des 
382,194,taxes  destin s   inciter les g n rateurs de pollution   modifier leur comportement  et les  instruments bas s sur l engagement volontaire des industriels   modifier leurs pratiques et limiter  ainsi les nuisances qu ils g n rent 
383,195,Cette dynamique est en train de se d velopper avec l approfondissement des instruments existants  et de la capacit  des pouvoirs publics   faire respecter la r glementation ainsi qu avec  l introduction d autres instruments  tels ceux bas s sur les m canismes de march  
384,195, L analyse  Co t B n fice de l impact du projet fait ressortir des r sultats physiques exceptionnels  
385,196,Les impacts du projet ont  t  enregistr s   b n fice  conomique et  cologique du Grand Annaba  L impact essentiel est illustr  par la diminution tr s sensible de la concentration de dioxyde de  soufre  SO2  dans l air  notamment au niveau d El Bouni    l investissement au niveau de l unit   acide nitrique a  galement contribu    cet effet  
386,196,De plus  un autre r sultat environnemental  important est  galement d    cette mesure    savoir l arr t du d versement du phosphogypse issus  de la production de l acide phosphorique 
387,197,L impact  conomique du projet dans la r gion de Annaba peut se r sumer   la conclusion que sur  la base de tous les b n fices  sant  publique  ecologiques  financiers   travers l impact sur la  rentabilit  des entreprises concern es et de l impact sur la valeur du patrimoine foncier   pour  chaque dollar investi  le projet a permis de g n rer un b n fice net de pr s de 6 dollars 
388,197, Concernant les b n fices li s aux co ts  vit s de sant   chaque dollar investi a permis de faire un  b n fice net de 1 7 dollars 
389,198,Outre les b n fices identifi s et valoris s ci dessus  le projet a permis  galement d atteindre de  nombreux autres r sultats tr s importants  
390,199,  Am lioration de la situation   cologique au niveau de la baie de Annaba  L augmentation  de la prise de poissons peut  tre consid r e comme une approximation par d faut de ce r sultat   contribuant ainsi   l augmentation du capital naturel de la r gion et du pays 
391,199,  Am lioration de la capacit  de gestion de la pollution industrielle aux niveaux local et  national  contribuant ainsi   l augmentation du capital humain de la r gion et du pays   Mise en place d un r seau automatique de mesure de la qualit  de l air  contribuant ainsi    l augmentation du capital mat riel et physique de la r gion et du pays   B n fices  conomiques du fait de l augmentation de la valeur  goodwill  des entreprises  concern es du fait de leur engagement environnemental  contribuant ainsi   l augmentation du  capital financier de la r gion et du pays 
392,199,  Am lioration de la confiance entre la population et l Etat du fait de la prise en charge  effective d un probl me qui affectait la sant  de la population  contribuant ainsi   l augmentation  du capital social au niveau de la r gion et du pays
