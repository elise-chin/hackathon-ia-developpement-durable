113,109,1  China s rapid growth has led to severe pressures on its environment and natural resources  with impacts on the  economy  human health  and global climate 
114,109,Over the past four decades  China has experienced an extraordinary period  of economic growth averaging over 10 percent per year  with a 25 fold increase in per capita income 1 The Government  announced on February 25  2021  that it had reached its goal of eliminating rural extreme poverty 2 However  such rapid  growth has resulted in challenges of pollution and inefficiencies in resource use 
115,109,The implied economic cost of  environmental degradation was estimated as 2 2 to 3 1 percent of gross domestic product  GDP  annually between 2004  and 2017 3 evident in widespread air  soil  and water pollution and diminishing biodiversity levels 4 Impacts from climate  change have compounded these environmental issues and contributed further to economic costs 5 These damages are  increasingly reflected in community concerns  with the number of related petition letters and visits received by the central  government increasing 16 fold between 1996 and 2018 6 In 2020  the Yale Environmental Performance Index ranked China  120 out of 180 countries based on multiple environmental dimensions 
116,109,While this is an improvement over previous years   multiple environmental indicators remain below those of other income comparable  upper middle income countries 7 
117,110,2  Recognizing these challenges  transitioning to a more balanced and sustainable economic growth model has  become a key policy priority 
118,110,China s 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   2016 2020  emphasized the need for high quality green  development based on productivity and innovation  rebalancing of growth toward consumption and services  and  increased stringency of environmental regulations 8 Central government funding of environmental protection and  pollution control increased to US 35 7 billion by 2019  five times more than in 2017 9 China saw a slowdown in the growth  of greenhouse gas  GHG  emissions  reduced local air and water pollution 10 improved resource efficiency  and enhanced  land management during this period 11 The 14th FYP  2021 2025   released in March 2021  reflected a strengthening of  ambitions  including planned reductions in GHG emission intensity and improved water pollution and land management   and references the importance of climate change adaptation 
119,110,The intended shift toward green development is  encapsulated by the concept of an  ecological civilization  a more harmonious relationship between society and the  environment 12 This concept represents a key political vision and was enshrined in China s constitution in 2018 13 
120,111,3  Addressing water pollution  including plastic debris  and improving riverine ecological health are integral  elements of this greener vision 
121,111,Despite some improvements in recent years  challenges of water quality remain acute 14  Around 29 percent of major rivers fail to meet the basic quality standards  grades I III  required for drinking water supply 
122,112,  1 Income per capita rose from US 300 in 1978 to US 10 276 in 2019  Extreme poverty rate fell from 88 1 percent in 1981 to 3 2 percent by the end  of 2018

137,114,Biodiversity faces continued threats from water  pollution  urbanization  overabstraction  and other human uses of the water environment  with climate change  compounding these threats by shifting habitat ranges and amplifying weather extremes such as drought 16 Studies have  also highlighted the role of China s rivers in transporting plastic waste to oceans 17 While there is a need for further  research  an estimated 17 2 million tons of China s plastic waste is mismanaged 18 and between 1 32 and 3 53 million tons  of plastic enter China s oceans  primarily via rivers  every year 
138,114,In the absence of interventions  this volume is expected to  grow as the consumption of plastics doubles over the next two decades 19 Across types and sources  the cost of water  pollution in China was estimated at US 141 billion nationwide in 2017 20 
139,115,4  The Yangtze River Basin and the economic belt it defines is a necessary focus of the Government s efforts toward  a greener China 
140,115,The Yangtze River Basin includes 19 provinces  municipalities  and autonomous regions  including the  nine provinces and two municipalities that define the Yangtze River Economic Belt  YREB  
141,115,21 The Yangtze River the  world s third largest and its basin play a major role in the historical  cultural  and political identity of China and have  important implications for China s water  food  and energy security 
142,115,The annual water resources of the basin are estimated  at over 995 billion cubic meters  roughly 35 percent of the national total 
143,115,Over 200 billion cubic meters of water are drawn  from the basin annually  supporting industry and providing drinking water for almost 600 million people 22 The YREB is an  important manufacturing hub  lying at the heart of global supply chains  and is one of the world s busiest inland waterways  for freight traffic 
144,115,In 2018  the GDP generated in the YREB was estimated at US 5 7 trillion  CNY 40 3 trillion   accounting  for 45 percent of national GDP 23 If the YREB were a country  it would be the third largest economy in the world 24 
145,116,5  The Yangtze River Basin has some of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world 
146,116,The Basin is one of the world s  most biologically diverse ecoregions due to its climatic and geographic variation  as well as its complex hydrology and  floodplain dynamics 25 The Basin supports over 200 fish species  more than 84 mammal species  60 amphibian species   and 87 reptile species 
147,116,It has a forest coverage rate of over 40 percent and is home to some of China s most iconic and  endangered species  including the Chinese sturgeon  finless porpoise  Chinese alligator  and the giant panda 
148,116,It is home to  33 percent of the rare or endangered freshwater fish species in China and accounts for around 40 percent of the country s  rare or endangered plants 
149,116,The Basin s lakes provide critical habitat for internationally migratory birds  including 95  percent of the wintering Siberian white crane population  
150,117,6  The Yangtze River and its tributaries face persistent challenges of water pollution and ecological degradation 
151,117, Over the past four decades  the Basin has experienced large scale  high intensity development and water polluting  industrial activity  and the Yangtze is today one of the most human affected large rivers in the world 
152,117,Development has  severely impeded hydrological flows  sediment transportation  and nutrient distribution  Urban areas have increased

164,120,dramatically  and lake and wetland areas have decreased  with more than 800 lakes within the central basin lost to land  reclamation 
165,120,Over 40 percent of lakes and reservoirs across the Basin are subject to eutrophication26 with agricultural NPS  pollution  notably runoff from excessive fertilizer application  a major contributor 27 The resulting degradation of water  quality and loss of ecological function is driving losses of globally significant biodiversity  as well as undermining the Basin s  contribution to human uses 28 
166,121,7  Of water pollutants affecting the Yangtze  total phosphorus is one of the most problematic 
167,121,China s chemical  fertilizer use  at 322 kg per ha  is almost three times the global average of 137 kg per ha 29 The Yangtze River is reportedly  among the top major rivers globally most severely affected by phosphorus 30 The largest source of phosphorus in the  Yangtze River Basin is intensive agriculture  including chemical fertilizer use in vegetable and cereal cropping  along with  livestock and poultry operations 
168,121,Domestic wastewater is another major source 
169,121,Phosphorus contributes to reduced water  quality in key biodiversity areas  including Poyang and Dongting Lakes  major wetlands systems providing habitat to an  estimated 400 000 species of waterbirds  including the critically endangered Siberian white crane  and other species such  as the finless porpoise 
170,121,Phosphorus that reaches the oceans contributes to algal blooms and hypoxia in coastal waters 
171,121, These challenges are not unique to China  with the United Nations Environment Programme  UNEP  and others  highlighting that there is an imbalance in the global phosphorus cycle that threatens ecosystems and food security 31  
172,122,8  The Yangtze River is also reported to be a major source of global marine plastic pollution 
173,122,A 2015 study32  estimated that China is a significant contributor to ocean plastic debris and that its rivers most notably the Yangtze are  the primary conduit  making China s contribution to combating marine plastic pollution critically important 
174,122,While there  is a need for more research on precise volumes  uncollected or mishandled rural waste and agricultural plastics are likely  to be major sources 33 with the Yangtze River delivering an estimated 0 31 0 48 million tons of plastic to the ocean every  year 
175,122,Marine plastic pollution has detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems through entanglement and indigestion by  wildlife and ecotoxicity impacts on micro organisms 34 Plastics remain in the oceans for hundreds of years  gradually  disintegrating over time  with small particles and polymers entering food chains with potential risks for human health 35  Direct economic damages include reduced fisheries value  losses in the marine and coastal tourism sector  and impacts  on shipping  with an estimated direct cost of at least US 11 billion annually in the Asia Pacific region alone 36  
176,123,9  Many of the challenges facing the Yangtze River Basin are exacerbated by climate change  while the region is  itself a source of GHG emissions 
177,123,A Climate and Disaster Risk Screening37 plus peer reviewed literature highlights that the

193,126,A 10 21 percent increase in runoff is forecast for  2041 2070 relative to 1970 2000 38 which is likely to exacerbate flooding and associated economic costs39 and increase  the levels and variations in water pollution  including plastic debris  due to more intense precipitation and floods events  resulting in spikes in runoff 
194,126,Changes in the hydrological regime are likely to increase pressure on biodiversity and  ecosystems  particularly sensitive wetland and floodplain species  and the fact that past flows are not necessarily a good  predictor of future flows will have implications for longer term ecological protection 
195,126,Water pollution also contributes to  GHG emissions  notably due to methane released from the eutrophication process that occurs in nutrient enriched waters 
196,126, The overapplication of synthetic fertilizers also leads directly to GHG emissions from the soil  most notably nitrogen  dioxide 40 
197,127,10  Efforts to improve ecological protection and reduce water pollution in the Yangtze River Basin are critical if the  Government is to achieve its stated water and environment objectives 
198,127,The Government s overarching objectives are  articulated by a series of targets and plans for water and the environment 
199,127,The  Most Stringent System for Water Resource  Management  was established in 2012  setting  Three Red Lines  with specific targets for water withdrawals  water use  efficiency  and water quality 
200,127,The  Water Ten Plan   issued in 2015  proposed measures to strengthen water pollution  control and improve ecosystem services 
201,127,These have been complemented by three further  redline  policies promoting  green development  the  Ecological Redlines   the  Environmental Quality Baseline   and the  Resource Utilization  Threshold  
202,127,These complement wide ranging sectoral reforms aimed at addressing persistent pollution challenges 
203,127,For  example  a National Sustainable Agricultural Development Plan  2015 2030  targets zero growth of fertilizer as part of  efforts to combat NPS pollution and reduce GHG emissions 
204,127,The waste management sector is under transition as part of  efforts toward a circular economy 
205,127,Sector developments include policies banning certain plastic waste imports in 2017   plastic pollution control measures  January 2020   and specific provisions in the Solid Waste Law  April 2020  to improve  the management of solid waste and reduce plastics use  including agricultural plastic film 41 Moreover  China s National  Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan  2011 2030  targets measures to address environmental pollution  given the significant impacts on aquatic  riverine  and coastal biodiversity and habitats  specifically prioritizing efforts in  Yangtze River to improve conservation of rare and critically endangered species  such as the Siberian white crane  Chinese  sturgeon  and finless porpoise 
206,127,The geographic and economic significance of the Yangtze River Basin ensures that progress  within the Basin will substantially determine national outcomes  
207,128,11  Significant public and private infrastructure investments have resulted in improved water quality in the Yangtze  River Basin  however  further improvements will require institutional measures 
208,128,The proportion of major river basins  meeting drinking water standards  class I III  increased from 61 percent in 2011 to 83 percent in 2020 
209,128,Despite these  achievements  control of some specific pollutants remains challenging 
210,128,Total phosphorus levels  for example  remain  above national standards in some water quality monitoring sections 42 The portion of lakes and reservoirs in the Yangtze  River Basin exhibiting  moderate  eutrophication43 increased from 31 percent in 2009 to 42 percent in 2018 44 While  further infrastructure investments are needed for the control and treatment of point and non point sources of pollution  in specific locations  broader and sustained improvements will require improvements in institutions and management

220,131,These include harmonized and better enforced standards  integrated monitoring platforms  basin wide data and  management systems that can improve coordination between branches and levels of government  and improved technical  understanding of pollution hotspots and sources 
222,132,12  Recognizing these needs  the Yangtze River Protection Law45 was approved by the National People s Congress  on December 26  2020 
223,132,The law came into effect in March 2021 and is the first legislation for a specific river basin in China 
224,132, It was formulated to strengthen the protection and restoration of the ecological environment in the Yangtze River Basin   it proposes the establishment of a National Yangtze River Basin Coordination Mechanism46 and infers obligations on the  national line agencies and provinces to align with its goals of ecological protection and improved water quality 
225,132,The law  calls for local governments to establish water quality baselines  prepare total phosphorus pollution control plans  reduce  pollutant discharge through investments in wastewater treatment facilities and piped networks  and control agricultural  NPS pollution  including through the promotion of organic fertilizers and control of agricultural plastic film 
226,132,The law also  calls on governments to protect and restore ecological function and biodiversity  including through ecological flows  and  improve systems for information sharing and inter jurisdictional cooperation 
227,132,The law is an element of the Government s  national strategy for the YREB  which was articulated in the  YREB Development Plan  developed by the National  Development and Reform Commission  NDRC  in 2016 
229,133,13 
230,133,The Yangtze River Protection Law represents the latest in a series of national level reforms aimed at improving  the management of natural resources and the coordination of water resources development 
231,133,Earlier reforms include an  amendment to the National Water Law in 2016 to support integrated planning and coordinated basin development 47  Water related responsibilities were reorganized within the administrative government system in 2018  with water  pollution control responsibilities transferred to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment  MEE   a new Ministry of Natural  Resources  MNR  established  and responsibilities within the Ministry of Water Resources  MWR  consolidated 
232,133,The  Government established the River Chief System  RCS   a network of officials at the provincial  municipal  county  and  township levels  who are assigned responsibility for outcomes along each section of every major waterway 
233,133,The system  evolved from efforts to solve water pollution issues in Lake Tai in 200748 and was implemented nationally in 2016 
234,133,It raises  the priority of water related issues and has proven useful in addressing challenges of coordination and cooperation  between responsible departments and regions 49 Implementation of the RCS is supported through various mechanisms  including River Chief Offices  RCOs   that usually sit within water agencies at the respective levels 50 China now has over  1 2 million river chiefs with more than 460 000 in the Yangtze River Basin  providing opportunities to address information  asymmetries  promote integrated basin management  and increase public participation in the decision making process 51

245,136,While these institutional reforms provide the foundation for integrated river basin management  the transition  is challenged by overlapping institutional and jurisdictional mandates  among other factors 
246,136,The YREB Development Plan  and Yangtze River Protection Law are relatively high level instruments  and their measures require new regulations and  operating procedures at multiple levels of government 
247,136,More broadly  while the institutional reforms of 2018 signaled an  important shift toward environmentally oriented water policies and clarified responsibilities  they also created challenges  such as the division of responsibilities in basin level organizations between water quantity management  under the MWR    water quality management  under MEE   and ecosystem services  under MNR  
248,136,China s river basin organizations do not  have the administrative authority or the coordination mechanisms required to align provincial actions  build consensus  with local government  or arbitrate in cases of dispute 
249,136,Operating efficiency in some water related infrastructure is low   and the knowledge base for integrated river basin management  for example  eco hydrology and related pollution flows   requires further development 
250,136,Key water related data are still segregated across various platforms and agencies  and the  availability of data and consistency over time and between different sources remain a challenge 52 Data sharing within and  between the RCS and the traditional basin management authorities is limited  and data collection protocols are not fully  standardized 53 Addressing these challenges requires an appropriate institutional framework  such as that envisaged by  the National Yangtze River Basin Coordination Mechanism  the continued resolve of political leaders  and mechanisms  that can facilitate inter jurisdictional cooperation and cross sectoral coordination 
252,137,C  Relationship to the CPS CPF and Rationale for Use of Instrument 
253,138,15  The proposed Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  YRPERP  or the  Program   see  Section II  emphasizes global public goods 
254,138,This is aligned with the World Bank Group s Country Partnership Framework   CPF  for China  FY 2020 2025   Report No 
255,138,117875 CN   which was discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive  Directors on December 5  2019 54 and the new phase of the World Bank Group s engagement in China 
256,138,Specifically  the  program focuses on institutions and systems for integrated basin management that can make a significant contribution to  global public goods through pollution reduction and biodiversity protection  Box 1  
257,138,It thus contributes to Engagement  Area 2 of the CPF   promoting greener growth   by reducing water and marine plastic pollution and strengthening  sustainable management of natural resources 
258,138,Moreover  lessons and knowledge generated by the Program are expected  to be relevant for addressing integrated natural resource management issues elsewhere and may be scaled up  including  with non World Bank Group resources  in other basins in China and internationally 
259,138,The Program aligns with the World  Bank Group s Green  Inclusive  and Resilient Development  GRID  framework and the Climate Change Action Plan 2021  2025 55

268,141,Box 1  Contribution of the Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program to Global Public Goods 
269,142,The Program contributes to three primary global public goods  reduce pollution  plastics and phosphorus   support biodiversity   and reduce GHG emissions   
270,143,  Marine plastics  The Yangtze River is estimated to be one of the world s largest single riverine sources of plastics  which affect  marine ecosystems and wildlife via entanglement and indigestion and ecotoxicity 56 The Program builds on an increasing  portfolio of World Bank financed projects supporting the collection and removal of plastic waste 57 including agricultural plastic  films that commonly ends up in waterways 58 The Program will support the development of implementation plans for plastic  pollution management in demonstration provinces for longer term institutionalized impact 
272,144,  Greenhouse gases  The Program will lessen eutrophication and thus methane emissions from waterways  a potent GHG  source 59 This will be achieved through the support for measures such as manure management and reuse  increased treatment  plant operating efficiencies  and management plans for key nutrient pollutants  actions that reduce nutrient loads in waterways  and thus eutrophication 
274,145,  Phosphorous  Phosphorus contributes to reduced water quality in lakes and rivers and contributes to algal blooms and hypoxia  in coastal seas 
275,145,An imbalance in the global phosphorus cycle is a major threat to ecosystems globally  driving biodiversity loss   fish kills  and GHG emissions at a global scale and degrading coastal ecosystems 60 These effects will be exacerbated by climate  change 
276,145,Support for improved phosphorus source identification  measurement  and mitigation under the Program is expected  to benefit ecosystems locally while providing lessons for improved phosphorus management in large watersheds globally 
278,146,  Biodiversity  The Yangtze River Basin is a globally significant biodiversity hotspot 61 Its waterways  floodplains  and wetland  systems provide habitat to a range of endangered species and internationally migratory birds  and the Poyang and Dongting  Lakes target areas within the Program are home to five Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance 62 The Program will  support implementation of water and environment management plans that promote habitat protection  as well as ecological  flows that safeguard water for the environment 
279,146,The Program will also support research on ecological restoration and protection  measures at the basin level  
280,147,The actions supported by the Program that contribute to these outcomes are described further in section II  
281,148,16  A Program for Results  PforR  has been identified as the most appropriate instrument to help improve the  targeting and results orientation of public expenditures in support of the YREB 
282,148,The PforR is designed to support a nested  hierarchy of interlinked institutional improvements at multiple levels basin  province  sub basin  and county that are  required to address the Basin s challenges in a complex and evolving development context  box 2  
283,148,The PforR instrument  leverages significant resources under existing Government programs  providing for impact beyond traditional Investment  Project Financing  IPF  
284,148,The PforR focuses on a subset of activities where the Government wants to enhance efficiency   effectiveness  and impact of expenditure by linking the disbursement of funds to the achievement of specific results 
285,148,The  reliance on Government systems  and the design of the Program through a nested hierarchy  is aligned with China s fiscal  governance structure and differentiated responsibilities across governance levels  as specified under the Yangtze River  Protection Law  
286,148,The PforR instrument is also conceptually aligned with the results based design of many of China s land

297,152,Box 2  Evolution of World Bank Support in the Yangtze River Basin 
298,153,The World Bank has a long history of supporting China s efforts  toward sustainable development 
299,153,Since 1981  the World Bank has  financed more than 170 projects with over US 26 billion in  commitments in China 
300,153,The majority of these have been in transport   31 percent of financing   water  24 percent  and energy  16 percent    Figure 1  
301,153,Water s proportion is above the World Bank s global  average  which is around 15 percent   placing China among the  largest of the Bank s borrowers in the water sector 
302,153,Projects have  been increasingly concentrated in the provinces of the Yangtze River  Basin  accounting for 64 percent of projects  81  and 57 percent   US 10 15 billion  of financing between 2009 and 2018  Figure 2  
304,154,The design of these projects has evolved to respond to the  changing development context  Early support in the water  sector focused on infrastructure and rural development 
305,154, The Yangtze River Basin Water Resources Project   P003596   for example  approved in 1995  supported multi  purpose dam construction  flood management measures   and the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation  schemes with capacity building 
306,154,The subsequent CN  Yangtze Dike Strengthening  P064730  Project in 1998 and  the Changjiang Pearl River Watershed Rehabilitation  Project  P081255  in 2006  focused on essential  infrastructure and sustainable rural development 
308,155,In more recent years  project focus has evolved toward more complex issues around integrated water resource management   ecological protection  and natural resources institutions 
309,155,The YRPERP will build on China s now considerable capacity for  infrastructure development by focusing on contemporary challenges of inter jurisdictional cooperation and cross sectoral  coordination 
310,155,It supports a nested hierarchy of activities that link financing with performance based targets at the basin  provincial   and local levels  to address challenges of ecological protection and water pollution 
311,155,World Bank support aims to unblock institutional  processes that are limited not by technical capacity but by constraints and incentives that undermine collaboration and data sharing  across and between levels of government 
312,155,The Program aims to have long term institutional impact by linking financing to  performance based targets  strengthened monitoring and evaluation  M E   analytical and policy development  and demonstration  effects that amplify the impacts achieved within the Program s demonstration counties into longer term provincial and basin wide  outcomes 
314,156,  63 Eco compensation programs aim to financially incentivize improved land and water management by sub national governments  firms  or  households  See World Bank  2021

319,160,17  The PforR will support a subset of activities from the sub national provincial programs for the YREB in Jiangxi  and Hunan Provinces 
320,160,These form part of a national program for the YREB which is articulated through the YREB  Development Plan 
321,160,The YREB Development Plan aims to prioritize ecological protection  river basin coordination  and  integrated development across the YREB 
322,160,Implementation of the YREB Development Plan is guided by the  Action Plan for  Yangtze River Protection and Restoration   the Action Plan  64 In addition  provincial level subsidiary plans outline local  actions and the expected results that contribute to the YREB Development Plan and Action Plan 
323,160,These national level and  provincial level plans are an integrated package that collectively define the Government program 
324,160,The national level plans  provide the overarching vision and broadly defined actions  with the provincial subsidiary plans outlining more specific  actions tailored to each province s circumstances 
325,160,The Yangtze River Protection Law  see para  12  provides important  elements of the legal framework for the Government s program 
326,160,The Program assists the selected provinces to meet some  of the requirements under the Law and implement their provincial level plans 
327,160,Two provinces  Jiangxi and Hunan  have  been selected for support under the World Bank financed Program  discussed further in Section C below   
328,161,18 
329,161,The Government s program at the provincial level in Jiangxi is outlined in the  5 Rivers 1 Lake  Plan 65 Issued in  March 2019  the 5 Rivers 1 Lake Plan covers the Poyang Lake Basin  defined by the lake and its five major tributaries 66  which spans 94 percent of the province 
330,161,The plan aims to  promote coordinated socio economic development and  sustainable resource management  safeguard the health of rivers and lakes  and ensure environmental protection while  supporting a rich  beautiful  happy and modern Jiangxi   It outlines the basic principles  guidelines  and implementation  arrangements for management and protection of Poyang Lake Basin  along with specific activities and targets within seven  priority areas   a  coordination for integrated management   b  spatial management and shoreline protection   c  water  resources protection   d  water pollution control including solid waste management   e  water environment improvement    f  rehabilitation of river and lake ecosystems  and   g  enhancement of river and lake management capacity 
331,161, Implementation is supported by the Jiangxi River Basin Eco Compensation Mechanism  which pools67 a range of financing  sources including earmarked funds from national  provincial  municipal  and county governments  as well as private sector  contributions 
333,162,19 
334,162,The Government s program at the provincial level in Hunan is outlined in the  Integrated Water and  Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin  68 Issued by NDRC in December 2018  the plan covers Dongting  Lake Basin  defined by the lake and its four major tributaries 69 The basin area spans 97 percent of Hunan  along with small  parts of Hubei Province 
335,162,The objective of the plan is to ensure the safety of water supply and to significantly improve water  and environmental quality 
336,162,It outlines the basic principles  guidelines  and implementation arrangements for governance 
337,163,  64 Eight priorities are outlined in the Action Plan   a  establishing an ecological and environmental control system and strictly implementing the  ecological redlines   b  investigating and managing sewerage outlets and promoting integrated land water monitoring and management systems    c  strengthening the control of industrial pollution and reducing environmental risks   d  improving environment conditions in rural areas including  control of agricultural non point source pollution   e  addressing gaps in environment related infrastructure  and ensuring the security of drinking  water sources   f  strengthening pollution control from inland waterways transport  and preventing environmental risks at harbors and ports   g   optimizing the allocation of water resources and ensuring ecological flow requirements  and  h  enhancing ecosystem protection

598,266,Both Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces have indicated that they would like to apply for a 25 percent advance  payment  US 49 0625 million for Jiangxi Province and EUR 42 125 million for Hunan Province  under the PforR 
599,266,The  amount of the advance will be deducted from the total amount due to be disbursed when the DLIs are achieved  and the  World Bank will record an amount of the advance as disbursed for an achieved Disbursement Linked Result   recovered    after it has notified the borrower of its acceptance of the evidence of achievement of the result for which the advance  was provided 
600,266,The reclassified amount will become available for further advances 
601,266,The cumulative disbursement in the  first two years after Board approval is not reasonably expected to exceed 60 percent of each IBRD loan based on the  amount of the advance  along with the DLIs expected to be achieved in the first two years of implementation  the timing  of the annual verification cycles  which will need to be completed before disbursements against achieved DLIs   and the  disbursement schedule of the Basin IPF 
602,266,Accordingly  the IBRD loan for this operation is not deemed as fast disbursing 
603,266, The World Bank requires that the borrower refund any advances  or portion of advances  if the DLIs have not been met   or have been only partially met  by the Program closing date 
604,266,If by the end of the Program  the PforR financing amount  disbursed exceeds the total amount of Program expenditures  the borrower refunds the difference to the World Bank  
605,267,44  The PPMO will be responsible for consolidating reports from provincial agencies participating in the PforR and  submitting to the PDF  copying the CPMO 
606,267,Disbursements will be made annually upon verification of the results of the  DLIs  see section II on DLIs and verification  
607,267,The PPMO will submit a verification letter with the results to the World Bank  and  upon acceptance of the verification results by the World Bank  the PDF will prepare disbursement applications and  submit them to the World Bank 
608,267,The applied disbursed amount will depend on the verified results 
609,267,Some annual allocations  are scalable and non fixed  meaning that the World Bank will disburse for over performance up to the DLIs  total allocation   see annex 2  
610,267,Over performance will enable the PDF to bring forward disbursements from Year 4 and 5 to Years 2 and 3 
611,267, The PDF can apply for disbursements as soon as the province meets targets  provides the necessary evidence to the World  Bank  and the World Bank accepts that evidence in a formal notice to the borrower with the disbursement amounts 
612,267,The  PDF can also ask to be reimbursed for any results achieved beyond the indicative annual target up to and not exceeding  the total PforR target and amount allocated for those DLIs that are scaleable and confirmed by the World Bank 
613,267,A  Designated Account  DA  for the Jiangxi PDF will be set up in US dollars  while a separate DA will be set up for Hunan PDF  in euros   
614,268,45  Technical capacity is generally strong but will benefit from capacity building in select areas 
615,268,The technical  assessment  see section IV  has identified areas requiring strengthening which are reflected in actions captured by the  Results Framework 
616,268,These include development of a public engagement manual for river chiefs with details on the roles  and responsibilities of all parties  increasing gender inclusion  capacity building  technical support  the means for inclusion  of local knowledge in decision making  and provisions for citizen feedback and increasing gender inclusion 
617,268,The  development of strategic plans for sustainable wastewater services by counties is intended to improve their operational  efficiency  with training on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste management for farmers aimed at improving  water pollution control 
618,268,Provinces are responsible for these measures 
619,268,The Central Basin IPF will also provide capacity  building on technical topics  including indexes for monitoring river health  and the determination  monitoring  and  supervision of ecological flows  through workshops and study exchanges 
621,269,46  The participating provinces are experienced with IPF projects but have less experience with results based  financing in the water and environment sector 
622,269,Fiduciary and E S assessments have identified needs including  strengthened occupational health and safety  OHS  procedures and management for temporary workers in relation to  construction and facilities operation  strengthened monitoring mechanisms on livelihood restoration for those affected  by land acquisition  strengthened community engagement and public consultation  and strengthened grievance redress

625,271,Training on the Environmental and Social Framework  ESF  and the related standards applications will  be provided to the CPMO for implementation of the Central Basin IPF  as this is the first time the CPMO has used the ESF 
627,272,47  The technical assessment has established a sound PforR boundary 
628,272,The Program is embedded within the  Government s national program for the YREB at the central basin level and within the sub national programs at the  provincial level 
629,272,These provide a nested hierarchy of activities and objectives  aligned with administrative responsibilities  of the different levels of government and the provisions of the Yangtze River Protection Law  see section I  
630,272,The law s  passage was a key step toward ecological protection and restoration of the Yangtze River and reflects the importance  placed by the Government on the strategy for the YREB 
631,272,The activities supported by the Program contribute to  implementation of the law and more broadly to the YREB strategy 
632,272,The two provinces are critical to outcomes in the  Yangtze River Basin and have signaled their commitment to the national strategy through their subsidiary plans  see  Program Description  section II  
633,272,Provincial plans have targets aligned with the 14th FYP 
634,272,In geographic terms  Jiangxi and  Hunan are key to the Basin s environmental outcomes with their location in the middle reaches of the basin  major source  tributaries  and high agricultural and industrial production 
636,273,48  The assessment confirmed the soundness of the activities and their connection to the Program s desired  outcomes 
637,273,Three distinct but complementary sets of activities are included in the design  see section II  that are integral  to the Government program  improvement of institutional mechanisms for coordination around ecological protection and  water pollution control  Results Area 1   enhanced integrated water environment planning and ecological flows in target  sub basins  Results Area 2   and activities that contribute to reduce pollutants entering waterways  Results Area 3   Figure  7  
638,273,These are supported by the Central Basin IPF that will provide   a  inter jurisdictional cooperation and data sharing   b   research based technical guidance related to key activities  such as guidelines for the evaluation of river health and  ecological flows  strategies for total phosphorous pollution prevention and control  and recommendations for the  systematic protection and restoration of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake  and  c  overall coordination and TA

642,276,49  The technical assessment found that cross sector coordination and inter jurisdictional cooperation the focus  of Results Area 1 remain the most challenging task for improving basin management 
643,276,The Program will support the  RCS  specifically its coordination platforms and data sharing 
644,276,The RCS promotes water resources protection  shoreline  management  water pollution prevention and control  water environment management  and restoration of water  ecology 86 Under the RCS  each part of a river and lake is assigned to a particular official at the provincial  municipality   county  and township levels  which helps address coordination and assignment of responsibility challenges between  departments and regions 
645,276,With more than 1 2 million river and lake chiefs appointed  over 460 000 in the Yangtze River  Basin  this innovative system seeks to address the challenges of integrated water resources management  IWRM  and  water pollution control through promoting cross sector coordination and inter jurisdictional cooperation 
646,276,The challenges  of cross sector coordination and inter jurisdictional cooperation have been recognized in previous World Bank  engagements with lessons derived for the present Program  Box 3   
647,277,50  Support for coordination mechanisms and data sharing platforms under Results Area 1  and the Central Basin  IPF  is an important element of a more effective RCS 
648,277,A basin level collaboration mechanism for the RCS was established  by the CWRC in July 2021 
649,277,The coordination mechanism revolves around the six main tasks of the river chiefs  with the  aim of promoting coordination among the 19 provincial RCOs and the CWRC  and is expected to facilitate joint planning  and coordination in policy implementation for river protection and restoration 
650,277,Design of the mechanism was financed  through the World Bank TA project  Promoting Economic Reform and Capacity Building  
651,277,A working conference and  information management platform are to be established under the basin RCS coordination mechanism 
652,277,The working  guidelines for the basin RCS coordination mechanism requires each of the provincial RCOs to strengthen cooperation and  coordination through the joint development  co management  and sharing of information  with the CWRC to lead in  establishing a water related information management system for the Yangtze River Basin 
653,277,Each of the provincial RCOs is  required to establish a provincial level RCS information management system and provide  maintain  and update  information in a timely manner to ensure the completeness  accuracy  timeliness  and availability of information and data  to promote the basin wide information sharing system and big data center 
654,277,Data include sectoral planning  water  mining   environment  waterway  and so on   water resources  water quality  water ecology  water emergency  and pollution  discharge licenses 
655,277,The information platforms for the provincial RCOs will be connected to the national level platform for  the inter ministerial joint committee on the RCS administered by the MWR and to the basin level information platform to  be developed by the CWRC 
656,277,Counties and municipalities will connect their local river chief information platforms to the  provincial platforms as part of Results Area 1   
657,278,51  The assessment confirmed a sound policy framework and rationale for integrated water environment  management planning and ecological flows the focus of Results Area 2 
658,278,The Yangtze River Protection Law commits  governments to determine  allocate  and monitor ecological flows for the Yangtze River s mainstream  major tributaries   and important lake sections 87 The technical assessment indicates that the provinces are working on systems to determine  ecological water allocations  yet water allocation formulas are based on relatively simplistic hydrological indexes to  determine minimum flow requirements rather than detailed assessments of ecological requirements 
659,278,The Program will  support the development and approval of basin level guidelines for the determination of river health and ecological flows  as part of the Central Basin IPF 
660,278,At the provincial level  the Program will support the monitoring and supervision of 
661,279,  86 State Council and the CPC Central Committee  2016  Opinions on Fully Promoting the River Chief Mechanism 
662,279, 87 The law requires river basin management agencies of the water resources departments to include ecological water in the annual water allocation  plan to meet the basic ecological needs  ensure ecological flow during the dry season and fish spawning period  maintain the water volume and  level of important lakes  and maintain a balance of salt and fresh water in the Yangtze River estuary 
663,279,The law also requires that water conservancy   hydropower  and shipping hub projects on the mainstream and major tributaries of the Yangtze River  and in the upper reaches of important lakes   incorporate ecological water allocations in daily operation and allocation procedures 
664,279,Where the discharge does not meet the requirements of  ecological flow discharge  the water resources departments at or above the county level are required to determine and supervise corrective  measures 
666,280,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
667,281,ecological flows 
668,281,It will also support the development and approval of sub basin or provincial level instruments to reduce  pollution  including solid waste management plans and phosphorus management guidelines  
669,282,52  Results Area 3 supports activities that reduce pollutants entering waterways and complements other Program  components 
670,282,Activities at demonstration county level include point source pollution control through improvements in  access and operations of township domestic wastewater collection and treatment services  along with NPSs of pollution  through improved management of plastic waste and increased utilization and management of animal manure 
671,282,Article 46  of the Yangtze River Protection Law requires provincial governments to formulate a total phosphorus pollution control  plan and organize its implementation  supported by Results Area 2  
672,282,The Central Basin IPF study on key pollutants will  focus on a basin level assessment of total phosphorous as well as establish the thresholds of key pollutants flowing into  the Yangtze River  helping the provinces to set emission control targets in the provincial plan 
673,282,These can help guide  provinces in preparing their own total phosphorus control plans  under an overall basin total phosphorus control target  
674,283,53 
675,283,The Program s interventions within demonstration counties focused on wastewater services  the prevention  of plastics entering waterways  and increased use of organic fertilizers are emphasized in the Yangtze River Protection  Law 
676,283,Article 47 requires county governments to make plans for the construction of centralized sewage treatment facilities  and supporting sewer networks  to improve sewage collection and treatment capacities  and also emphasizes the need to  clarify responsibilities and implement unified management 
677,283,The national 14th FYP for wastewater management calls for  promotion of integrated wastewater collection and treatment services 
678,283,Similarly  Article 48 commits to strengthening the  prevention and control of agricultural NPS pollution  with the application of chemical fertilizers to be reduced  the use of  organic fertilizers to be promoted  and agricultural waste such as plastic films to be disposed appropriately 
679,283,The dumping   burying  or treatment of solid waste is forbidden within control areas for rivers and lakes in the Yangtze River Basin  Article  49   and the county level governments are required to strengthen joint prevention and control of illegal transfer and  dumping 
680,283,In addition to direct activities toward these requirements under Results Area 3  the Program contributes through  support for the provincial level plans and guidelines for plastics and agricultural pollution management  Results Area 1  
682,284,54  Gender dimensions have been incorporated into the Program design to address gaps in participation and  decision making roles in both the RCS and township wastewater utilities 
683,284,These are based on preliminary assessments  in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces that show women are substantially underrepresented among both official and civil river  chiefs  with five or more male river chiefs for every female in the data sample provided by demonstration counties 88  Underrepresentation of women in these roles can influence the degree to which communities change pollution behavior   the types of investments prioritized  and the women s ability to gain experience and increase their job opportunities 
684,284,To  address the gaps  the Program will include activities to improve engagement and awareness  along with methods to  increase participation  female voice and agency in the local RCS and wastewater utilities 
685,284,A basin level case study of the  RCS will analyze the extent and drivers of the gender gap  raise awareness among Government officials  and draw lessons  to refine program actions 
686,284,A provincial public engagement manual to be developed as an intermediate outcome indicator  will include provisions to increase women s participation and decision making roles 
687,284,Implementation of the manual will  contribute to the Program s target of increasing female civil river chiefs from around 11 to 30 percent in the demonstration  counties 
688,284,Activities to address key gender gaps in township wastewater utilities are based on the finding that women  represent less than 40 percent of technical and managerial positions and female staff earn a quarter less  on average  than  male staff among the sample survey 
689,284,Gender stereotypes about leadership and decision making and limited  implementation of the Women s Development Plan are among the key drivers 
690,284,To address these gaps  the Program  includes provisions to address obstacles in attracting  recruiting  retaining  and advancing women as part of the  wastewater management strategies to be developed by the demonstration counties under the related DLI 
692,285,  88 The responsibilities and roles of civil river chiefs play an important role in river management and protection  complementing the formal river  chiefs 
693,285,The MWR issued  Implementation Opinions on promoting River Chief System  requiring enhancing the role of civil river chiefs in promoting  river management policies  collecting public feedback  supervising river chief performance  and bridging communications

697,288,The YRPERP draws on lessons from a range of World Bank financed programs and analytical work in transboundary river basins 
698,288, Although the Yangtze River is contained within China  it flows through 19 provinces  which have a high degree of autonomy in the  Chinese system 
699,288,In combination with China s multi tiered governance structure  national  basin  provincial  and local   this creates  challenges similar to those seen in transboundary contexts 
700,288,In response  the YRPERP links financing to performance based targets  that strengthen institutions for inter jurisdictional cooperation and cross sectoral coordination 
701,288,Specific actions are aligned with  the functions and responsibilities of existing organizations through a nested hierarchy of activities at the basin  provincial  and local  levels  providing a Program framework aligned with the decentralized and polycentric nature of river basin management in China 
702,288, Key lessons were derived from the following  
703,289,  The Danube Water Program  P159654  illustrates the importance of institutional and policy support for strong utilities and  sustainable water and wastewater services 
704,289,Since the adoption of the European Union Water Framework Directive  European  Union countries have used a river basin approach for water management  including the 19 countries that share the Danube  River Basin 
705,289,The Program supports the basin countries by informing the policy dialogue and strengthening institutional capacity  through partnerships with regional  national  and local stakeholders  
706,290,  The Nile Basin Program  P156765  highlights the benefits of investing in data and information to support infrastructure  planning and development  as well as capacity building  in managing joint development of shared water resources 
707,290,The World  Bank has been investing in the countries of the region for more than 20 years under a shared vision to cooperatively and jointly  develop shared water resources 
708,290,Regional norms and processes have been established to share information and conduct joint  modelling to inform the prioritization  planning  and implementation of investment projects across the basin 
710,291,  The Ganga River Basin Project  P119085  provides an example of measures to address water pollution and strengthen basin  management 
711,291,Building on an earlier World Bank project that financed sewage infrastructure in pollution hotspots along the  river  the project is building the capacity of the National Ganga River Basin Authority to establish management tools  investigate  environmental flow options  and collect and share data in a complex multi state governance setting 
713,292,  The Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program  P100406 and P103298  illustrates the challenges of coordination  relating to environmental management in transboundary basins 
714,292,The Program provided long running support for collective  management and governance through policy  legal  and institutional reforms 
715,292,These focused on environmental management  in pollution hotspots  mechanisms for cooperative management between the partner states  and environmental restoration of  degraded sub catchments  highlighting the time required to realize results when addressing NPS pollution 
717,293,  The Murray Darling River Basin provides an example of basin wide institutions and management tools to safeguard water for  the environment 
718,293,Analytical work in partnership with the Australian Water Partnership has highlighted institutional  arrangements for the allocation and measurement of environmental flows  environmental water holders  in inter jurisdictional  contexts 
719,293,A Basin wide Environmental Watering Strategy sets out objectives for river health  with water then allocated to  improve flows  water holders decide where and when environmental water will be delivered to achieve those environmental  objectives 
721,294,  The Framework for Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water Sector in Mexico  P120134  was a Development Policy Loan  supporting the government s efforts to mainstream adaptation to climate change in the water sector by strengthening  institutions  creating water banks  regulations  and monitoring capacity in integrated water resources management  as well as  incentives to improve data collection and flows of information  establish watershed management programs to improve water  quality at sub national levels  improve the productivity of irrigation  and  strengthen wastewater treatment to improve water  quality for groundwater recharge 
723,295,These activities  set within complex inter jurisdictional spaces with parallels to the Yangtze River Basin  have influenced YRPERP  activities on data sharing and coordination  integrated management planning  capacity building  environmental water allocations   and the use of demonstration investments to influence cross boundary outcomes 
724,295,It is also expected that YRPERP experience will  similarly contribute to global knowledge on mechanisms for transboundary management in multilevel governance contexts  for  example  systems within federated states or under regional management bodies  
725,295,The Chinese experience in complementing  infrastructure led water sector development with inter jurisdictional institutions for sustainable water management will be  valuable for World Bank clients looking to make a similar transition as their development needs evolve

728,297,55  As the Program boundaries are established within the two sub national provincial plans  the Program  expenditure framework is assessed at the provincial level 
729,297,Implementation of the national YREB program is funded  through a range of instruments at the provincial and local level in accordance with the responsibilities for expenditures  on ecological and environmental protection issued in May 2020 89 The actions required to meet the objectives of the  Program are not linked to specific government budget allocations  with the YREB Development Plan calling on inputs from  a range of stakeholders  including all levels of government 
730,297,Eco compensation mechanisms include those specific to river  basins  forestry  wetlands  green supply chain and procurement  ecological industries  and green finance and are  recognized as some of the financing instruments that will help achieve the goals of the national YREB strategy and its  provincial subsidiary plans 
731,297,The expenditure framework thus comprises multiple relevant budget lines rather than a single  Government program fund  
732,298,56  The expenditure framework in Jiangxi Province presents an adequate basis for the PforR 
733,298,Implementation of the   5 Rivers 1 Lake  Plan is partly funded from the provincial government s  River Basin Ecological Compensation Program    RBECP  
734,298,This covers all 100 counties in Jiangxi  including over 90 counties in the Poyang Lake Basin 
735,298,The RBECP is intended  to support ecological protection  water quality improvement  forest protection and improvement  and livelihoods 
736,298,Each  county is evaluated against three sets of indicators annually   a  water quality   b  forest and ecological conservation  and   c  water resource and water environment integrated management  with funds allocated according to results 
737,298,An  estimated CNY 14 billion  US 2 billion  has been invested through the RBECP from 2016 to 2020  averaging around US 400  million annually   including approximately US 1 4 billion from the central government through the National Key Ecological  Zone Program  NKEZP  supplemented through general provincial budget allocations and county contributions 
738,298,These funds  increased substantially from 2016 to 2018 and stabilized in 2019 and 2020  despite the impacts of tax cuts and COVID 19  on fiscal revenues 
739,298,According to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance  the RBECP funds will reach CNY 3 275 million   US 500 million  in 2021 and will be maintained at least at this level during the 14th FYP period and beyond  based on  which it is estimated that the RBECP funds for 2022 to 2026 will amount to CNY 16 375 million  US 2 519 million  
741,299,57  The provincial program is managed by the Budget Division of the PDF with results evaluated by the PDRC with  support from sector departments 
742,299,There is no program based expenditure classification in China s budget management  system  so the expenditures under the RBECP cannot be tracked precisely 
743,299,However  the use of the RBECP funds can be  assessed through the annual self review reports prepared by the counties 90 According to the self review reports  most  local governments  65 percent  use the RBECP as earmarked funds  with some local governments  28 percent  blending  the RBECP with other financial sources at the county level 
744,299,These show RBECP expenditures on water pollution reduction   28 5 percent   water ecological management  13 3 percent   waste management  12 9 percent   rural and urban  environment improvement  13 3 percent   forest improvement  5 9 percent   and institution improvements  4 percent  
746,300,58  The expenditure framework in Hunan Province presents an adequate basis for the PforR 
747,300,Implementation of the   Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin  Plan is funded from a number of sources  covering the entire Dongting Lake Basin 
748,300,From 2018 to 2020  roughly CNY 14 billion  US 2 16 billion  was allocated from  the central and provincial governments for water environment management in the Dongting Lake Basin 
749,300,The total funding  increased significantly from CNY 4 3 billion in 2018 to CNY 4 8 billion in 2019 and CNY 4 9 billion in 2020 
750,300,This indicates  that the source of funds for the Government program in Hunan Province is stable and guaranteed  These funds were  primarily from four programs  see annex 3  
751,300,In 2018  the largest source of financing came from Rural Environment

760,303,In terms of funding source by department  Table 5   DARA provides the  largest proportion  49 34 percent   followed by the DWR  37 70 percent  and DHURD  12 97 percent  
761,303,The total  Government financing for the program during the program implementation period  2022 to 2026  is estimated at CNY  23 446 million  US 3 607 million  based on the average financing for the three years from 2018 to 2020 
763,304,59  The final expenditures related to water environment management in Hunan Province were determined through  an analysis of the statement of government final accounts for the past three years 
764,304,According to the final account data   about CNY 24 34 billion  US 3 760 million  was used on water environment management from 2018 to 2020 
765,304,Almost 50  percent of the expenditures were used for  Water Pollution Prevention and Treatment   which includes expenditures for  wastewater treatment plants and pipelines 
766,304,This was followed by expenditures for  Rural Environment Management    24 58 percent   which includes rural wastewater treatment  waste management  and NPS pollution reduction 
767,304,Those two  expenditures together  approximately CNY 17 billion  exceed the financing amount in the three years  CNY 14 07 billion    indicating sufficient funding sources for the provincial program 
768,304,Provincial commitments toward implementation of the  Government program under the 14th FYP  2021 to 2025  amount to CNY 37 12 billion  US 5 73 billion   of which CNY 7 41  billion  US 1 14 billion  is allocated toward investments in water supply protection  CNY 21 99 billion  US 3 40 billion   invested in water pollution prevention and treatment  and CNY 7 72 billion  US 1 19 billion  invested in water ecological  protection and restoration  providing an adequate basis for this PforR 
770,305,60  Economic conditions in the provinces and the fiscal position of the provincial governments are sound and stable   see annex 3  
771,305,While the economic downturn in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic negatively impacted Government  finances  revenues are estimated to have recovered alongside economic activity in 2021 
772,305,The budget allocation for the  Program s activities accounts for around 1 0 and 1 2 percent of the general budget revenue in Jiangxi and Hunan   respectively  so financial sustainability and continuity of program related activities in the years beyond the Program are  not at risk 
774,306,61  Benefits from the Program are expected to accrue at both local and global levels 
775,306,At the local level  increases in  biodiversity and vegetative cover can be expected  together with a decrease in pollutants in major waterways and thus  periods of eutrophication  which can be expected to improve the amenity value of rivers and lakes  recreation  opportunities  real estate values  fishery productivity  shipping services  and tourism and reduce costs of water treatment 
776,306, Global benefits will result from improved biodiversity  such as benefits to internationally migratory birds  Dongting and  Poyang Lake are important migratory bird habitats   reduced coastal eutrophication  and reduced marine plastic debris 
777,306, Climate benefits  GHG mitigation  will be derived from reduced eutrophication91 of lakes and waterways caused by  discharges of livestock waste and wastewater and displaced use of synthetic fertilizer  as well as from more efficient  wastewater treatment and collection systems 
779,307,62  To estimate the Program s economic benefits  benefit transfer from available environmental valuation research  in China was used 
780,307,The economic values of water quality and ecological improvement are challenging to quantify due to  the dispersed spatial extent of benefits across the basin  the wide range  and indirect nature  of benefit types  and data  limitations 
781,307,However  four studies provide benefit estimations that can be adapted to the parameters of this program to  indicate its likely economic values 
782,307,These studies utilize the contingent valuation method92  CVM  to capture the broad  range of benefits  both use and non use economic values  that are expected 
783,307,Benefit estimates are incorporated into a  simple benefit cost analysis  BCA   applied at the sub basin level for Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake Basins  The 
784,308,  91 Eutrophication  caused by excessive richness of nutrients  increases the emission of methane  which is 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at  trapping heat in the atmosphere  based on IPCC  AR5  
785,308, 92 Contingent valuation method uses questionnaires targeted to affected populations to elicit their willingness to pay  WTP  for non market  environmental goods such as avoidance or reduction of pollution impacts 
786,308,It has been applied extensively to water pollution issues

788,310,assessment implicitly combines activities under Results Area 1  Results Area 2  and Results Area 3 to value outcomes as a  combined water and environmental quality improvement 
789,310,The assessment compares a  no program  scenario to a scenario  of a Government program including World Bank support 93 
790,311,63  Upper and lower levels of program benefit  based on household WTP and adjusted for provincial population  and income  are compared to total program costs  Table 3  
791,311,A lower bound on household WTP of 0 55 percent was used   based on the lower range of available estimates 
792,311,A 15 year period of analysis was used  with benefits starting in Year 5 of  and increasing to their full value within two years

797,314,GHG emissions reductions of 0 58 million tons CO2 e are expected due to PforR Program activities  Table 4    with an implied value  based on a shadow price of carbon  of US 17 9 36 3 million over the economic life of the  Program 94 Quantification of GHG emissions focuses on DLIs 3 1 and 3 3 
798,314,Mitigation is assessed over 15 years and is  compared to a no Program scenario  baseline  
799,314,Upgrades to the wastewater network and treatment operations is  expected to reduce emissions due to leakage of wastewater to groundwater 
800,314,The treatment and reuse of livestock poultry  manure  through on farm treatment facilities and organic fertilizer displacement of synthetic fertilizer  is also expected to  substantially mitigate emissions 
801,314,This assessment does not include the expected emissions reductions through  institutional  policy  and planning measures95 nor through ecological restoration  due to challenges in quantifying these  reductions  
802,314,The quantitative estimates presented here should thus be considered a lower bound on the Program s GHG  mitigation  Annex 3 contains further detail

805,316,Pursuant to the World Bank s Policy and its associated Directive on  PforR Financing of November 10  2017 and June 20  2019  respectively  as well as the World Bank s PforR Fiduciary Systems  Assessment Guidance Note issued on June 30  2017  the World Bank s Fiduciary Team carried out a fiduciary systems  assessment  FSA  
806,316,According to the FSA  and given the agreed actions to strengthen the fiduciary systems reflected in the  Program Action Plan  PAP  and other proposed mitigation measures that will be implemented  the Program s fiduciary 
807,317,  93 This approach is used because under a PforR  Government and World Bank funds are combined to achieve results  with limited distinction at the  activity level between World Bank financed and Government financed achievements 
808,317, 94 The shadow price of carbon is set at US 38 per ton  lower bound  and US 75 per ton  upper bound  in 2017  increasing by 2 25 percent per year   and applied to the quantified emissions reductions  in the form of an NPV  calculated here 
809,317,See annex 3 for details

813,319,systems  including the financial management  FM   procurement  and governance systems  are considered to adequately  meet the requirements laid out in the World Bank s PforR Policy and Directive 
814,319,They provide reasonable assurance that  the Program s financing proceeds will be used for the intended purposes  with due attention to the principles of economy   efficiency  effectiveness  transparency  and accountability 
816,320,66  Financial Management risks 
817,320,Major risks identified include the following   a  inadequate supervision on the usage  of Program funds by related provincial entities may bring potential risk of improper use of Program funds given that there  is no requirement for provincial governments to report Program expenditures in Hunan Province and the reporting  requirement stipulated in Government decrees have not been strictly implemented in Jiangxi Province   b  the program  has no budget classification element and the required Program financial reporting cannot be generated from the  Government treasury system  and  c  Government auditors have thus far not audited program funds and have not  prepared any program audit reports 
818,320,Although the proposed Program will be limited to the water and environment related  sectors  a number of activities will be included  which is expected to pose challenges to the auditors when planning  Program audits 
820,321,67 
821,321,Mitigation measures for the major FM risks will include  a  developing a tailored format for Program financial  reporting drawing on the experiences of other PforR projects in China  designed and agreed on by the World Bank and the  PDFs   b  the World Bank working with the Provincial Audit Office  PAO  to develop TOR to help coordinate Program audits  
822,322,and  c  outlining a pilot program for tagging Program related expenditures in the Government treasury system in the  Program Implementation Plan  PIP   allowing Program financial reports to be generated directly from the treasury system  and facilitate the external audit within the demonstration counties 
824,323,68  Procurement overview 
825,323,The Government of China has a robust legal framework for procurement  which includes  the Tendering and Bidding Law of 1999  the Government Procurement law of 2003  and regulations and orders issued at  national  provincial  and county levels 
826,323,Although the laws could be modernized and aligned to modern principles such as   value for money  and  fit for purpose   both offer a fair playing field for bidders and promote transparency and  competitiveness 
827,323,The Government has recently encouraged the use of electronic bidding 
828,323,All open bidding competitive  processes are conducted by public resources transaction centers  which provide facilities and modern platforms for  processing procurement activities electronically  
829,324,69  Procurement risks and mitigation measures  Four major procurement risks have been identified  
830,325, a  Contracts may be awarded to firms or individuals that are debarred or under temporary suspension by the  World Bank or other multilateral development banks 
831,325,The following mitigation measures are proposed   i   upon Program loan effectiveness  the Provincial Program Office shall issue a high level official letter or  official instruction to require Program Implementation Agencies  PIAs  to ensure that no contract will be  awarded to ineligible firms or individuals   ii  procurement staff at the PPMO are to check the latest list of  debarred and temporarily suspended firms and individuals before contract award to ensure contracts are  being awarded only to eligible firms or individuals  and  iii  the TOR for the annual external audit shall  include the task of randomly selecting contracts and assessing whether they have been awarded to an  ineligible firm or individual 
833,326, b  The World Bank may not be informed of fraud allegations and corruption issues during implementation 
834,326,A  PIP shall therefore require the client to inform the World Bank of any credible and material allegations of  fraud and any corruption issues as part of the Program progress reports  as mandated in the Loan  Agreement 
836,327, c  In Jiangxi  the Price Commitment Method is widely used for bid evaluation by using the cost estimate as a  key reference for contract price determination 
837,327,To avoid substantial deviation between contract price and 
838,328,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
839,329,the prevailing market price level  the PPMO is required to regularly update the cost estimate by taking  account of market variants in a timely manner to ensure realistic value for money is being achieved 
841,330, d  Contracts may not be completed within the contractual completion time  and the contract completion  audit may not be completed in a timely manner 
842,330,Human  financial  and policy resources should be allocated  by Hunan and Jiangxi PDRCs for close monitoring contract implementation progress to minimize or avoid  foreseeable cost overruns and or implementation delays 
844,331,70  Fiduciary risk rating  Considering the abovementioned FM and procurement risks  along with the proposed  mitigation measures  the overall fiduciary risk rating is assessed as  Substantial    
845,332,71  Fiduciary supervision  Procurement and FM are subject to annual audit by government audit offices 
846,332,Procurement  following the procedures of the Tendering and Bidding Law  TBL  is subject to regular supervision and oversight by DRCs  at various levels and relevant sector authorities  water  environment protection  agriculture  housing and construction   land and natural resources  
847,332,The Finance Department or Bureaus at various levels exercise regular supervision and  oversight for procurement following the procedures of the Government Procurement Law  GPL    
848,333,72  Fraud and corruption risks  The Government has institutions in place to combat fraud and corruption 
849,333,These  institutions are designed to prevent  report  detect  investigate  prosecute  and sanction fraud and corruption 
850,333,These  institutions include the discipline inspection commissions within all implementation agencies  supervision bureaus   anticorruption bureaus under People s Procuratorates  and audit offices  all at central  provincial  prefectural  and county  levels 
851,333,These agencies have comprehensive mandates to combat fraud and corruption  Any bidder or any party can report  fraud and corruption issues to any of these government agencies 
852,333,The World Bank s right to conduct an inquiry into such  allegations or other indications  independently or in collaboration with the borrower regarding activities and expenditures  supported by the Program  as well as its right to access to the required persons  information  and documents will be  observed in accordance with the standard arrangements for this purpose between the Government and the World Bank 
853,333, The Program s Legal Agreement will also oblige the client to fully comply with obligations under the World Bank s Anti  Corruption Guidelines for PforR operations  
854,334,73  An Environmental and Social System Assessment  ESSA  was conducted to provide a comprehensive review of  E S systems and procedures at the national level  as well as in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces 
855,334,The review recommended  actions to address gaps and opportunities to enhance performance during PforR implementation 
856,334,In addition  relevant  provisions of the World Bank ESF have been applied to the Central Basin IPF and an Environmental and Social Management  Framework  ESMF   a Stakeholder Engagement Framework  SEF   and an Environmental and Social Commitment Plan   ESCP  prepared in accordance with the requirements of the ESF 
858,335,74 
859,335,The ESSA was conducted according to the following methodology   a  thorough screening of the potential  impacts from the activities to be supported by the PforR   b  desktop review on E S laws and regulations and procedures  related to managing the relevant Program activities at the national  provincial  and local levels  and  c  field visits to sites  of typical Program activities in selected counties  with extensive meetings and interviews with key stakeholders ranging  from implementing agencies to government officials at provincial  county  township  and village levels and representatives  of local communities 
860,335,Observation and discussions during these visits provided a good understanding of the potential E S  impacts associated with the Program s activities and procedures and capacity of government departments for dealing with  such impacts  including measures adopted under relevant laws and regulations 
862,336,75  The ESSA considers the E S risk associated with the PforR Program to be substantial 
863,336,The Program will have  significant and broadly positive E S effects in the Program regions  including reduced wastewater  plastic waste  and  agricultural pollution  improved river and lake water quality  and ecological environment rehabilitation 
864,336,E S screening  was conducted on the proposed Program activities to exclude those with the potential to cause significant adverse impacts 
865,337,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
866,338,on the environment and or potentially affected people  including  a  activities involving closure or relocation of livestock   poultry  or aquaculture farming   b  activities involving large scale infrastructure construction   c  activities that have  substantial impacts on river hydrology and ecology  and  d  activities involving the allocation or conveyance of water   including inter basin water transfers or other activities  that could result in significant changes to water quality or  availability 
867,338,After applying these exclusion criteria  the Program will support pollution control and ecological restoration  activities including county  and township level wastewater treatment plants and pipelines  agricultural plastic film  collection and recycling  waste treatment of existing livestock farms  and institutional and capacity building activities 
868,338,The  main potential adverse impacts identified include construction related impacts such as dust  noise  disturbance of water  bodies  soil erosion  wastewater and solid waste management  construction workers  and community s health and safety   labor management  small scale land acquisition or restricted land access  temporary land use  impacts during operation  such as effluent discharge of wastewater treatment facilities  safe operation of facilities  labor management issues   workers  health and safety  and safe application of fertilizers  impacts on farmers  livelihoods  and also the potential  indirect downstream impacts of TA activities 
869,338,These adverse E S impacts are not significant and can be well identified and  readily avoided  minimized  and mitigated through mature technologies and good management practices 
870,338,Neither OP 7 50    Projects on International Waterways nor OP 7 60   Projects in Disputed Areas is applicable to the Program  
871,339,76  The ESSA concludes that China has established a comprehensive system for the management of E S issues at  both national and provincial levels  including in Jiangxi and Hunan Province 
872,339,The system consists of laws  regulations   guidelines  specifications  and standards principally consistent with the World Bank s PforR Policy and Directive 
873,339,This  system provides an acceptable basis for addressing the possible E S issues related to activities supported under the  Program   
874,340,77  The ESSA recommends that the PforR be used as an opportunity to strengthen the E S management capacity  of different stakeholders 
875,340,This could be achieved by  a  providing training on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste  management to farmers   b  establishing a sustainable incentive mechanism to increase collection rate  in which the  existing jobholders should be appropriately considered  for example  the village cleaners   c  enhancing the OHS  management of the enterprises involved in the Program activities  and  d  establishing a social impacts and risks screening   public participation  monitoring  and reporting mechanism 
876,340,To implement these recommendations  three actions have  been included in the Program Action Plan  PAP    a  provincial and county agriculture and rural affairs bureaus shall provide  trainings on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste management to farmers   b  PIAs shall strengthen OHS training  and regular health checkup for all in service workers  including temporary workers  and  c  PIAs shall establish a social  impacts and risks screening  public participation  monitoring  and reporting mechanism and strengthen information and  record management in social risk management 
878,341,78  Consultation and information disclosure 
879,341,Relevant stakeholders  including both government departments   enterprise representatives  and local communities  were consulted through meetings and field visits to selected counties 
880,341, The draft ESSA report was shared with the Jiangxi and Hunan PPMOs and selected counties  six counties of Dayu  Chongyi   Yugan  Yongfeng  Fuliang  and Yudu in Jiangxi  four counties of Shimen  Ziyang  Miluo  and Yuanling in Hunan   and  consultation workshops were carried out with the key stakeholders at the provincial and county levels 
881,341,The participants  voiced their support in implementing the proposed Program and concurred with the findings and recommendations of  the draft ESSA  which were considered relevant and valuable for strengthening the actual effectiveness of the  implementation of the existing E S system 
882,341,Some participants provided valuable opinions to improve the accuracy of the  ESSA description in local context  which have been reflected in the revised ESSA 
883,341,The draft ESSA was disclosed on the  World Bank s website on November 1  2021  and on the two provincial websites on November 4  2021  
884,342,79  The E S risks associated with the Central Basin IPF are rated Substantial  The relevant provisions of the ESF  apply 
885,342,The Central Basin IPF is not anticipated to support any physical activities but consists of basin studies on river health  and ecological flows  baseline studies and development of guidelines related to key pollutants such as phosphorus   research to inform implementation of the Yangtze River Protection Law  capacity building  institutional coordination 
886,343,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
887,344,mechanisms  and information management  along with the compilation of Program results and reporting  Implementing  the Central Basin IPF is assessed to have moderate social risks 
888,344,The potential risk relates mainly to health and safety risks  to field workers  for example  researchers  and inadequate consultations with stakeholders and are not considered likely  to cause any direct adverse environmental impacts 
889,344,There could be basin wide downstream E S implications related to  the implementation of the products or outcomes of the TA 
890,344,The downstream E S impacts could include environmental  impacts from new construction  rehabilitation  and operation of wastewater and solid waste collection and treatment  facilities  labor risks  community health and safety  restrictions on land use  resettlement  and exclusion risks for  vulnerable groups  among others 
891,344,The overall environmental and social risk classification  ESRC  is thus rated as  Substantial   
892,345,80  The relevant provisions of the World Bank ESF have been applied and the relevant instruments disclosed

903,347,82  The overall risk is rated Substantial 
904,347,The risk assessment is informed by the results of the technical  fiduciary  and  environmental and social systems assessments  with a summary of substantial  or higher  risks provided below  
905,348,83  The technical design risk is rated Substantial 
906,348,The Program s focus on improving cross sectoral coordination and  inter jurisdictional cooperation poses a technical risk given the involvement of multiple levels of government and line  agencies 
907,348,Challenges around cross sectoral coordination and inter jurisdictional cooperation motivated the 2018  ministerial reforms  see section I   and the Yangtze River Protection Law recognizes the importance of an integrated  approach to river basin management and ecological protection 
908,348,While the law calls for the establishment of a National  Coordination Mechanism  this mechanism has not yet been confirmed and there remains some ambiguity about the roles  and responsibilities of the various agencies  with coordination and information flow challenged by existing governance  structures 
909,348,The Program attempts to address this risk through its support to coordination measures  specifically Results  Area 1   as well as through construction of DLIs aligned with existing well defined areas of responsibility 
911,349,84  The risk related to sector strategies and policies is rated Substantial  The Program is informed by a  comprehensive set of Government strategies and programs with high level political support 
912,349,The YREB Development Plan 
913,350,   The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
914,351,is a high level program that calls on inputs from a range of stakeholders  including all levels of government  but is not  linked to specific government budget allocations 
915,351,While the boundaries of the YREB are broad  including a wide range of  potential activities implemented through various stakeholders and financing mechanisms  it is the sub national provincial  programs that form the Government program  a sub set of which is supported by the PforR 
916,351,The boundaries of the PforR  have been clearly defined within the context of the sub national provincial programs and screened to delineate the  boundary between those in the PforR and those outside its perimeter 
917,351,The support at the basin level is provided through  an IPF component  which also allows for clearly defined activities 
918,351,Institutional coordination and cooperation remain a  challenge to efficient implementation of sector strategies 
919,351,Limited data sharing between institutions and narrowly defined  institutional mandates makes cross sectoral implementation of policies challenging  and it is assumed that provincial  policies developed and approved under the Program will be enforced and not contradicted by county  or municipal level  actions 
920,351,Strengthening the RCS relies on a number of different stakeholders  along with the establishment and integration  of management information systems  to inform a number of actions that can deliver on the expected outcomes  improvements in inter jurisdictional cooperation at the basin level 
922,352,85  The implementation capacity risk is rated Substantial 
923,352,Despite significant experience in IPF operations  there is  limited experience with results based financing in the water and environment sectors 
924,352,Preparation has focused on defining  simple DLIs that target priority outcomes and ensure sufficient cashflow 
925,352,Training for provincial and local government  officials on the rationale and implementation of PforR has been used to improve understanding 
926,352,Implementation capacity  is also a risk at the central level  where the implementing agency  NDRC  has limited human resources for day to day  oversight 
927,352,Support from the CWRC is being used to mitigate this capacity risk   
928,353,86  The fiduciary risk is rated Substantial  Fiduciary systems  including the FM  procurement  and governance  systems  are considered adequate to meet the World Bank s requirements 
929,353,Risks include the potentially weak capacity for  local governments to raise counterpart funds 
930,353,In addition  the Government program has no budget classification element   and the required Program financial reporting cannot be generated from the Government treasury system 
931,353,Government  auditors have not yet audited the Program s funds 
932,353,A tailored format for Program financial reporting will be used drawing  on the experiences of other PforR projects in China  and the annual external audit process shall be used to ensure ineligible  firms or individuals have not received contracts 
934,354,87  The environment and social risk is rated Substantial 
935,354,The Program will have significant and broadly positive E S  effects in the target regions  and E S screening has been conducted on the proposed Program activities to exclude those  that could cause significant adverse impacts on the environment and or potentially affected people 
936,354,Central and sub  national governments have well established systems for mitigating risks 
937,354,Risks arise from the potential implementation of  products or outcomes of the TA  including the basin level studies on water pollution and ecological protection and  province level plans and policies 
938,354,Such indirect E S implications could include impacts from construction  rehabilitation   and operation of wastewater and solid waste collection and treatment facilities  labor risks  community health and safety  risks  restrictions on land use  resettlement  and exclusion risks for vulnerable groups  among others 
939,354,Risk mitigation is  provided by the ESF instruments prepared for the Central Basin IPF  the ESSA  and measures included in the PAP   
940,355,88  The stakeholder risk is rated Substantial 
941,355,The Program aims to improve institutional coordination  an ambition  that inherently faces stakeholder risks  given the need to coordinate and find consensus among disparate actors at  different levels of government 
942,355,The Program s design addresses this issue by supporting a coordination mechanism at the  basin level and promoting cooperation in data sharing and knowledge exchange 
943,355,Program supported activities rely on  cooperation of sector agencies 
944,355,The role of the PDRC as the provincial level counterpart and the use of results based  financing that incentivizes action across sector agencies help mitigate this risk

1302,698,1  The Program is designed to address some of the key challenges facing IWRM in China 
1303,698,Complex problems exist  in interregional  intergovernmental  and inter departmental collaboration  which reduces coordination and thus efficiency  of water resources and water environment management 
1304,698,The implementation difficulties of IWRM in China may be  ascribed to factors such as an amorphous definition  operational difficulties  departmental conflicts  and lack of defined  authority for river basin management 97 Recent institutional reforms in China are facilitating improved coordination and  cooperation 
1305,698,For example  the Yangtze River Protection Law  passed in 2020  provides a legal foundation for basin specific  coordination in China and could be eventually transposed to other major river basins 
1306,698,It is the first legislation for a specific  river basin in China and infers specific obligations on the national agencies and provinces  delineates responsibilities  and  requires systems for information sharing and establishing of forums for knowledge exchange and decision making  between jurisdictions 
1307,698,The River Chief System  RCS   implemented nationwide in 2016  is another example of an institution  that facilitates inter jurisdictional cooperation 
1308,698,The system is formed by a network of officials  each responsible for their  own section of river but coordinated through sub national and national forums and data sharing platforms that help create  a unified view of the basin 
1309,698,The ministerial reform of 2018 and the ministries that resulted are also important steps  forward  with complementary responsibilities for water management brought together 
1310,698,to the Program supports  implementation efforts related to these reforms through its nested hierarchy of activities across three Results Areas and  the Central Basin IPF 
1311,698,This annex summarizes the technical assessment  covering the Program s boundary and definition   expenditure framework  diagnostic of key challenges  and suitability of the activities to address these challenges  see full  Technical Assessment for further detail  
1313,699,2  The PforR will support a subset of activities from the Government s sub national provincial programs for the  YREB as defined in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces 
1314,699,Supported activities contribute to ecological protection and water  pollution reduction goals contained in the provincial plans that themselves contribute to the overarching national plan 
1315,699, The provincial plans represent the Government s program  in conjunction with the province s 14th Five Year Plans  and  contain a larger set of activities than the Bank s Program  these activities are described  and screened for high risk  activities  in the full Environmental and Social Systems Assessment 
1316,699,The timeline for the PforR is 2022 to 2026  with 2021  the baseline year against which outcomes are measured  The Program s geographic scope and demonstration counties  are described in Section II C  
1317,700,3  China has a highly decentralized fiscal structure  with responsibilities for providing public services decentralized  to sub national governments 
1318,700,As of 2019  sub national governments accounted for 85 30 percent of total public  expenditure 
1319,700,Tax rates for major taxes are set centrally with revenues being shared between different levels of  governments 
1320,700,In addition  significant shares of revenues are transferred from the central government to the provinces  and from provinces to lower level governments  both as earmarked and general purpose grants 
1321,700,These transfers are  generally adequate to cover the gap between revenues and recurrent expenditures at the sub national level 
1322,700,Counties  receive transfers from upper level governments and play a key role in providing public services to the residents 
1323,700,The  expenditure responsibility between the central government and provinces and in turn between province and county  governments were further delineated during the 13th FYP  helping to increase clarity around SNG mandates and  accountability 
1324,700,Notably  the high degree of fiscal decentralization mean that many substantial national programs do not

1327,703,have an explicit budget framework at the central level  budget is instead allocated at provincial and local levels in  alignment with the overarching vision set by the central government  
1328,704,4  The Program s hierarchical design is aligned with the responsibilities for ecological and environmental  protection are divided at central  provincial  and local levels 
1329,704,According to the Reform Plan for Delineating the Functions  and Expenditure Responsibility between the Central Government and Provinces regarding Ecology and Environment  Protection 98 national level ecological environment planning  policy and law making  implementation monitoring   management  law enforcement  and capacity building has been classified as a central functionality  prevention and control  of water pollution in key basins such as the Yangtze has been classified as shared functionality  and local level ecological  environment planning  policy and law making  implementation monitoring  management  law enforcement  and capacity  building  as well as the prevention and control of agricultural and rural pollution  solid waste pollution  chemical pollution   groundwater pollution  and other local air and water pollution  has been classified as local functionality 
1330,704,Following such  principles  the Program activities for Results Area 1 and Results Area 2 will be financed by the provincial governments with  support of the central government  and the Program activities for Results Area 3 will be financed mainly by county  governments with support of the provincial government 
1332,705,5  Total Program financing over 2022 2026 is expected to be US 6 526 million 
1333,705,An expected US 6 126 million   93 87 percent  will be funded by the Government and US 400 million  6 13 percent  will be financed by IBRD loan  see  Section II C  
1334,705,Of the US 6 126 million government funding  it is estimated that US 2 519 million will come from Jiangxi  Province and US 3 607 million will come from Hunan Province 
1335,705,The IBRD loan will comprise US 392 5 million as part of  the PforR in support to the two sub national provincial programs  with US 196 25 million for each province  and US 7 5  million for the Central Basin IPF 
1336,705,The Program Expenditure Framework is defined at the Provincial level  through the Jiangxi    River Basin Eco Compensation Program  and budget lines associated with the Hunan   Integrated Water Environment  Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin 
1338,706,6  In November 2015  Jiangxi Province initiated the RBECP  defined by the  River Basin Ecological Compensation  Methods in Jiangxi Province  for Trial Implementation    The Methods  
1339,706,The Program covered 100 counties in the Poyang  Lake basin including its five major tributaries of Gan  Fu  Xinjiang  Rao  and Xiu 
1340,706,From 2016 to 2020  managed by the Jiangxi  PDF  about CNY 14 billion  US 2 billion  of Government expenditure was channeled through the RBECP  averaging around  US 400 million annually  Table 3 1  
1341,706,The amounts grew substantially from 2016 to 2018 and stabilized in 2019 and 2020   despite the negative impacts of tax cuts and COVID 19 on fiscal revenue 
1342,706,According to officials from the Jiangxi PDF  the  RBECP funds will reach CNY 3 275 million in 2021 and at least maintain this level during the 14th FYP period and beyond 
1343,706, Therefore  the World Bank team estimates the RBECP funds in 2022 to 2026 will reach CNY 16 375 million  or US 2 915  million  using an exchange rate of 6 5 1

1347,710,7  The Program has a variety of funding sources and is relatively stable 
1348,710,Among the US 2 billion channeled through  the program between 2016 20  approximately US 1 4 billion was a general transfer from the central government and the  NKEZP  with the rest coming from the provincial general budget and contributions from the counties  Figure 3 1  
1349,710,Funds  allocated by the central government accounted for the highest proportion  more than 60 percent since 2017 
1350,710,This suggests  that the source of funds for the RBECP in Jiangxi Province is relatively stable and guaranteed

1352,712,8  Expenditure of the RBECP is aligned with the proposed Program activities 
1353,712,According to The Methods issued in  2015 and amended in 2018  the RBECP funds should be mainly used for ecological protection  water environment  management  improvement of people s livelihoods  and related activities 
1354,712,There is no program based expenditure  classification in China s budget management system  so the expenditures arranged from the RBECP funds cannot be  tracked precisely 
1355,712,Based on self review reports  most local governments  64 95 percent  use the RBECP as earmarked  funds  and a small proportion of local governments  27 84 percent  blend the RBECP with other financial sources at the  county level 
1356,712,As shown in Figure 3 1  right   of all the RBECP spending  the expenditures on water pollution reduction  accounted for 28 5 percent  water ecological management for 13 3 percent  waste management for 12 9 percent  rural  and urban environment improvement for 13 3 percent  forest improvement for 5 9 percent  and institution improvement  for 4 0 percent 
1357,712,In general  the expenditure of the RBECP is aligned with the proposed Program activities  
1358,713,Hunan  Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin 
1359,714,9 
1360,714,In Hunan  the major Program activities water pollutant reduction  water ecological restoration and relevant  institutional innovation are covered by the  Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake  Basin   2018 2025  
1361,714,The Plan is financed by several sources of budget funding and covers the entire Dongting Lake Basin 
1362,714, From 2018 to 2020  roughly CNY 14 billion  US 2 16 billion  was allocated from the central and provincial governments  for water environment management in the Dongting Lake Basin 
1363,714,The total funding increased significantly from CNY 4 3  billion in 2018 to CNY 4 9 billion in 2020 
1364,714,This suggests that the source of funds for the Government program in Hunan  Province is relatively stable and guaranteed  These funds were primarily from four programs  Table 3 3  
1365,714,In terms of  funding source by department  DARA provides the largest proportion  49 34 percent   followed by DWR  37 70 percent   and DHURD  12 97 percent  
1366,714,The total program financing during the 14th FYP  2022 to 2025  is estimated at CNY 23 446  million  US 3 607 million  based on the average financing for the three years from 2018 to 2020

1374,722,10  Final expenditure of the Government program suggests sufficient funding is being provided 
1375,722,According to the  final account data  about CNY 17 6 billion  US 2 708 million  was spent on water environment management from 2018 to  2020 
1376,722,Almost 66 percent of the expenditures were used for  Water Pollution Prevention and Treatment   which includes  expenditures for wastewater treatment plants and pipelines  followed by expenditures for  Rural Environment  Management   34 percent   which includes rural wastewater treatment  waste management  and NPS pollution reduction 
1377,722, Those two expenditures together roughly match the financing amount in the three years  CNY 14 07 billion   indicating  sufficient funding sources for the Provincial Program 
1378,722,Provincial commitments toward implementation of the Government  program under the 14th FYP  2021 to 2025  amount to CNY 37 12 billion  US 5 74 billion   of which CNY 7 41 billion   US 1 14 billion  is allocated toward investments in water supply protection  CNY 21 99 billion  US 3 40 billion  invested  in water pollution prevention and treatment  and CNY 7 72 billion  US 1 19 billion  invested in water ecological protection  and restoration  providing an adequate basis for this PforR

1382,725,11  Program expenditure efficiency focuses on whether the Program expenditures can achieve the desired targets  and realize value for money  The following mechanisms are supportive of efficiency  
1383,726,  Funding Allocation Rule  RBECP funds are allocated to different counties according to four sets of indicators    a  performance in water environment improvement   b  performance in forest quality improvement   c   performance in water resource management  and  d  the ecological importance of the county 
1384,726,Each year   evaluation of those indicators is conducted by relevant departments and the results used to determine the  counties  available amounts for the subsequent year 
1385,726,Therefore  the funding allocation rule provides a strong  incentive for the counties to achieve the desirable objectives set by the provincial government and helps  ensure value for money  
1386,727,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
1387,728,  Expenditure performance evaluation rules  In Hunan  expenditure performance evaluation rules have been  established and applied to all the earmarked funds  which help ensure value for money 
1388,728,So far  the team has  not been able to access the evaluation reports  so the effectiveness of the performance evaluation is still  uncertain  
1389,729,  Higher Level Government Transfer Mechanism  Program financing in both provinces is targeted toward  lagging regions 
1390,729,According to self reviewed reports from 76 counties in 9 municipalities in Jiangxi Province in  2018  the amount of the RBECP allocated to each county  cities  districts  has a significant negative  correlation with its economic development level and with the level of local government financial resources   see Figure 3 2  
1391,729,The less developed the local economy is  and the less its fiscal revenues are  the greater the  amount of RBECP allocated 
1392,729,This is in line with compensation for the foregone development opportunity of  less developed counties to protect their environment and ecology  
1393,730,Figure 3 2  Allocated RBECP and GDP  left   Total Fiscal Revenue  right  by County in 2018

1395,732,12  The overall financial situation in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces appears stable  Table 3 1 and Table 3 2  
1396,732,The  unfolding context associated with COVID 19 is expected to have negative short lived impact on the Government finance 
1397,732, The budget funding of the Program activities accounts for only about 1 percent of the general budget revenue in Jiangxi   Table 3 1   so financial sustainability is not a major concern 
1398,732,Similarly  in Hunan  the overall financial situation is sound  and stable  it can also be seen that the budget funding of the Program activities accounts for only about 1 percent of the  general budget revenue in Hunan  see Table 3 6

1441,772,13  The technical assessment confirmed the soundness of the activities and their connection to the Program s  desired outcomes 
1442,772,Three distinct but complementary sets of activities are included in the PforR design  improvement of  institutional mechanisms for coordination around ecological protection and water pollution control  Results Area 1    enhanced integrated water environment planning and ecological flows in target sub basins  Results Area 2   and activities  that contribute to reduced pollutants entering waterways  Results Area 3  
1443,772,These are supported by the Central Basin IPF  that will provide  a  overall coordination   b  technical guidance to provinces to ensure alignment across the basin related  to key activities  such as the guidelines for the evaluation of river health and ecological flows  strategies for total  phosphorous pollution prevention and control  and recommendations for the systematic protection and restoration of  Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake  and  c  inter jurisdictional information and data sharing 
1445,773,Results Area 1  Improving Institutions and Innovations for Integrated River Basin Management 
1446,774,14 
1447,774,Complex problems exist in interregional  intergovernmental  and inter departmental collaboration in water  resources management  which reduces the coordination of water resources and water environment management 
1448,774,The  inefficiency of IWRM and the difficulty of implementing it in China may be ascribed to factors such as amorphous  definition  operational difficulty  departmental conflicts  and lack of authority in river basin management 99 Institutional  reforms in China are facilitating improved coordination and cooperation but require further operationalization and  deepening to deliver on their potential 
1450,775,15  A focus of the Program is the RCS  a key institutional innovation that aims to address these challenges 
1451,775,Since it s  formalization nationwide in 2016 100 more than 1 2 million river and lake chiefs have been appointed at provincial   municipal  county  and township  and village levels 
1452,775,Each part of a river and lake is assigned to a particular official who is  responsible for addressing coordination and cooperation between departments and regions 
1453,775,There are six main tasks  focused on  a  water resources protection   b  shoreline management   c  water pollution prevention and control   d   water environment management   e  restoration of water ecology  and  f  law enforcement 
1454,775,The results are included in  the administrative assessment of the officials in charge  providing career related incentives and accountability  mechanisms  within a system that works across agency lines 
1455,775,River chiefs receive assistance and support from the River  Chief Office  which often sits within the related water agencies at the respective levels 
1456,775,The office is composed of chiefs  and key staff from major related departments  Regular river chief meetings bring sector department leaders together for  consultation and decision making

1460,778,16  Information management platforms are required under the national guidelines and are being established at  various levels of government to support RCS implementation and operation 
1461,778,These range from relatively simple  administrative systems to more sophisticated information platforms with decision support functions supported by  physical monitoring networks and public participation 101 A national pilot level platform has been developed  and a range  of provincial and local level platforms are being implemented on a trial basis 
1462,778,However  these often have limited  functionality and are only partially connected across different jurisdictions and levels of government  
1463,779,17  A basin wide coordination mechanism for the RCS along the Yangtze River was proposed by the CWRC through   Working Guidelines  issued on July 26  2021 
1464,779,When operating  the mechanism will bring together the 19 Provincial RCOs  and the CWRC for consultation and decision making  including through a working conference organized by CWRV 
1465,779,The  coordination mechanism is supported by an office set up at the CWRC  headed by the Director of the CWRC RCO 
1466,779,Working  guidelines outline the mechanism s intended key tasks  including research and policy development  data collection and  monitoring  sharing of experience  and public outreach 102 Design of the basin wide RCS coordination mechanism was  supported through the World Bank financed TA project  Promoting Economic Reform and Capacity Building  and its  establishment included as part of the CWRC s plan during the 14th FYP period for implementing the Yangtze River  Protection Law 
1468,780,18  An information management platform is to be established under the basin RCS coordination mechanism 
1469,780,The  working guidelines for the basin RCS coordination mechanism requires each of the Provincial RCOs to strengthen  cooperation and coordination through the joint development  co management  and sharing of information 
1470,780,Under the  provision of the working guidelines  the CWRC is to lead in establishing an information management system for the  Yangtze River Basin RCS 
1471,780,Each of the provinces is required to establish their provincial level platforms  which should be  synchronized for basin wide information sharing 
1472,780,Each of the members of the coordination mechanism is required to  provide continuously updated data on sectoral planning  water  mining  environment  waterways   water resources  water  quality  water ecology  water related emergencies  and pollution discharges  among others 
1473,780,Among other uses  these data  are important for climate informed management decisions  policies and strategies including water management and  pollution control under flow extremes 
1474,780,The integration of the basin and provincial systems   the latter also drawing on the  local level systems   intends to eventually provide a comprehensive information basis for IWRM from county to basin  level 
1476,781,19  The RCS also provides an opportunity to promote engaging the public in river protection and water pollution  control 
1477,781,The River Chiefs are active in organizing public awareness campaigns and education programs  appointing  nongovernmental river chiefs  inspectors  and cleaners  supporting volunteer groups  and setting up hotlines and mobile  applications for citizen engagement and feedback on the performance of their river chiefs 103 These efforts are to be 
1478,782,  101 For sophisticated platforms data include   a  administrative functions relating to the river chiefs  river patrols  water pollution and illegal natural  resources exploitation supervision  reporting and resolution coordination  public participation    b  water quantity data  precipitation  water level   flow  hydrology information    c  water quality data  temperature  pH  dissolved oxygen  conductivity  turbidity  ammonia nitrogen  total  phosphorus  total nitrogen  permanganate index  fluoride    d  monitoring of soil and water conservation  illegal construction and solid waste  dumps  and  e  drainage and solid waste management  drainage networks  conveyance systems  sewage pipelines and pump stations  
1479,782,See full  technical assessment for more details 
1480,782, 102 Key tasks for the mechanism stipulated in the working guidelines include   a  conducting studies to support planning of transboundary rivers and  lakes   b  implementing the water resource management mechanism   c  jointly promoting shoreline protection of the Yangtze River   d  jointly  promoting water pollution reduction and eutrophication management   e  jointly promoting river and lake ecological protection and restoration   f   jointly enforcing relevant regulations and policies   g  establishing a monitoring network covering hydrology  water quality  water ecology  and so  forth   h  establishing information sharing and river health assessment   i  conducting joint research on key issues including water ecology  restoration technologies  horizontal eco compensation and so forth  and  j  conducting information  education  and communication  IEC  activities  and improving public awareness

1484,784,supported by the basin wide RCS coordination mechanism  the working rules for which requires the 19 provinces and the  CWRC to promote public awareness and participation of the river and lake chief systems and the Yangtze River Protection  Law  to enhance the public s sense of responsibility and participation in river and lake protection 
1485,784,Public participation also  provides an opportunity to increase community awareness of climate change issues including increased flood and  drought risks  water scarcity  and water quality implications 
1486,784,However  there are currently no systematic guidelines to  structure engagement of the public in efforts around ecological protection  water pollution control  and climate resilience  for the Basin overall or in many Basin jurisdictions 
1488,785,20  The challenges and opportunities identified for strengthening mechanisms for coordination and collaboration  have informed Results Area 1 and the Central Basin IPF 
1489,785,The RCS can be improved by the following   a  Accelerated  implementation of the basin level mechanism and working conference for better coordination between the river basin  organization and the provinces   b  Integration and expansion of the data monitoring and information sharing platforms  for a holistic and real time understanding of biophysical conditions and river chief operations   c  Deployment of advanced  technologies such as remote sensing that can complement manual river patrols and provide insights for inter jurisdictional  decision making   d  Use of third party monitoring and verification to strengthen the accountability of the river chiefs   e   Development of guidance for public engagement in the form of manuals to share approaches and lessons across  jurisdictions  including for climate change awareness   f  Greater focus on gender balance in river chief appointments   both paid and voluntary 
1490,785,These actions have informed the construction of DLI 1 and other parts of the Results Framework  
1491,786,Results Area 2  Advancing Ecological Protection through Integrated River Basin Management 
1492,787,21  Functional riverine ecosystems and their biodiversity require that sufficient water is allocated for  environmental purposes 
1493,787,104 China has conducted ecological flow practices for around 40 years but in limited ways 
1494,787,In  April 2020  the MWR issued an Opinion105 aiming to strengthen ecological flow practices by determining the ecological  flow targets for important rivers and lakes  establishing ecological flow monitoring and regulation systems  and setting  targets to ensure ecological flows for the mainstream and major tributaries of the Yangtze River by 2025 
1495,787,The Opinion  required the river basin commissions and local water departments to consider the ecological flow requirements as rigid  targets in water allocation 
1496,787,In July 2020  the MWR further announced a Working Plan 106 which set targets to determine  ecological flows for important rivers and lakes including those of the Yangtze River Basin 
1497,787,Determination of ecological flow  requirements for 52 rivers and lakes in the Yangtze River Basin was included in the tasks for the CWRC from 2020 to 2022   including Xiang  Zi  Yuan  and Li Rivers in Hunan and the Gan  Fu  and Xin Rivers in Jiangxi 
1498,787,Jiangxi and Hunan are responsible  for determining the ecological flows for Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake  
1499,788,22  The Yangtze River Protection Law commits governments to increasing ecological water management in the  Yangtze River Basin  Article 31  
1500,788,The law requires water resources department to include the ecological water volume in  the annual water allocation plan to meet basic ecological flow demand of rivers and lakes  ensure ecological flow during  the dry season and fish spawning period  and to maintain water levels in important lakes 
1501,788,Jiangxi and Hunan provinces  have identified ecological flow requirements based on minimum flow methods 107 as well as augmented flow requirements  for some specific river segments flowing through important ecological areas 
1502,788,Regarding the Program s sub basins  the  overall water allocation plan for Hunan s Yuan River was approved in November 2020   108 and the plan for Jiangxi s Gan

1508,791,River is under preparation  However  such plans only establish the water quota at the provincial level and require a further  allocation to the county level  
1509,792,23  The effectiveness of ecological flows would also benefit from consideration of intra annual variations 
1510,792,More  detailed water allocation plans are needed to determine the annual  seasonal  and monthly allocations required to ensure  ecological function  which rely on particular water cycles as much as minimum flows 
1511,792,This is particularly the case in the  context of climate change  which is expected to cause greater variability in flows and place pressure on aquatic ecosystems  that compounds other pressures such as human use and development 
1512,792,Water dispatch plans are required to manage basin  water use  jointly operate reservoirs  and respond to the emergencies of droughts and water contamination disasters   balanced with these ecological needs 
1513,792,Ecological outcomes would also benefit from consideration of both water quantity  and quality requirements in allocation decisions  
1514,793,24  Actions have been identified based on the assessment to strengthen ecological flows and integrated river basin  water environment management under the Program 
1515,793,These include   a  Water resources allocation to the county level  as the basis for water withdrawal licensing   b  Ecological flows implemented and monitored against minimum  performance standards   c  Tailored river lake ecosystem health evaluation guidelines developed by the provinces to  guide the determination of ecological flows  which will then be used for ecological flow supervision in the demonstration  sub basins  this aims to extend minimum flow type ecological allocations for broader consideration of river ecosystem  health considerations in line with international practice    d  An inter provincial river chief cooperation mechanism to  strengthen integrated cross border water environment management in the Yuan river 109 and  d  A dedicated ecological  environment management information platform for the Gan river  covering both water pollution control and ecological  protection and restoration  with decision support function for more effective operational management and supervision 
1516,793, These actions inform the design of DLI 2 and other parts of the Results Framework  
1517,794,Results Area 3  Reducing Water Pollution and Transmission of Plastic Waste 
1518,795,25  The Yangtze River Protection Law requires governments to address point source and non point source  pollutants 
1519,795,Article 47 requires counties to improve urban and rural wastewater collection and treatment capacities  clarify  entities responsible  and implement unified management of systems 
1520,795,Similarly  Article 48 commits governments to  strengthening the prevention and control of agricultural non point source pollution  with the use of organic fertilizers to  be promoted and agricultural waste such as agricultural plastic film to be appropriately disposed 
1521,795,Support for counties  under Results Area 3 aims to address these priorities with a focus on phosphorus pollution  which has become the primary  pollutant in many areas of the Yangtze 
1522,795,The Yangtze River is among the top five major rivers globally most severely affected  by phosphorus110 with significant sources including fertilizer use  livestock and poultry operations  and wastewater 
1523,795,The  technical assessment found that phosphorus concentrations spike to levels beyond prescribed limits more frequently than  other pollutants in the Program s sub basins 111 Actions further support reduction of COD from wastewater and  agricultural plastics 
1525,796,26  China has invested substantially in its wastewater infrastructure systems since 1996 and achieved nearly  universal coverage 
1526,796,The emphasis of China s wastewater treatment now is to improve the quality of services as well as  the efficiency of investment by enhancing financial viability and leveraging private sector participation 
1527,796,Wastewater  collection is separated from wastewater treatment in many localities  resulting in large portions of the collection network

1534,800,27  Assessment in demonstration counties reveal that almost all the counties have sufficient wastewater treatment  capacity  but face efficiency and management challenges 
1535,800,Challenges include   a  the domestic wastewater management  services are fragmented  with the treatment plants being managed by one entity  mostly outsourced private sector  operators  while the sewer network is managed by the county bureau or county level public entity or company  resulting  in a lack of accountability for ensuring service quality   b  influent concentrations  Biological Oxygen Demand  and  COD  to the treatment facilities are usually low as a result of the combined effect of incomplete collection networks and  household connections  mixed wastewater and stormwater drainage  and poor conditions of the existing network due to  deferred maintenance  resulting in many WWTPs operating at a low efficiency level  and  c  a lack of sustainable financing  with the costs of the domestic wastewater management services covered from two sources   i  a wastewater service  charge paid by the customers that typically covers only the outsourced treatment service provider who is responsible for  the O M of the WWTP and  ii  subsidies through budget allocations from the county finances  which are used for O M  of the wastewater collection system and often limited to urgent repairs 
1536,800,The assessment also found gender gaps among  workers in the sector 113 
1537,801,28  In response to these challenges  the Program supports actions to strengthen integrated wastewater  management services 
1538,801,Actions include   1  Development of integrated wastewater management strategy in  demonstration counties  including financial sustainability  integrated O M  employment equity  workforce roadmap for  women and climate resilience and low carbon technologies   2  Increased COD reduction  influent COD minus discharged  COD  at township level wastewater treatment plants  and  3  Integrated institution agreements  one entity responsible  for O M of sewer network and wastewater treatment plants

1541,802,29  The Yangtze River is a major contributor to global marine plastic pollution 
1542,802,The Yangtze River Basin reportedly  transmits the largest total volume of marine plastics of any of the world s rivers  with an estimated 0 33  range 0 31 0 48   million tons of plastic discharged into the East China Sea annually 114 The Government is tackling the plastic pollution issue  through investments in solid waste management  bans on the import of waste recycling materials  bans on some single  use plastic items  regulations on the use of agricultural plastic film  improved monitoring  reporting and supervision  and  promotion of eco design and material recycling  among other measures 
1544,803,30  Agricultural film is a major contributor to riverine and marine plastic pollution due to the lack of management  system  that is  collection and recycling  in rural areas 
1545,803,China has the world s largest agricultural film consumption  2 6  million tons in 2015  and land coverage  around 20 million ha  115 The recycling rate of agricultural film is less than two  thirds 116 While agricultural film has important benefits in terms of water efficiency and crop growth  uncollected plastic  film waste in fields is negatively impacting land productivity

1556,806,Hunan and Jiangxi are major users of agricultural  plastics117 and have set targets for collection and recycling in line with the central government s targets 118 
1557,807,31  The two main challenges are to provide adequate financial incentives to farmers for collection  and to establish  financially sustainable channels for recycling 
1558,807,The Program will provide support for activities that address these  challenges in support of high levels of collection and recycling in demonstration counties  see full technical assessment  for county level baselines and targets  
1559,807,Agricultural plastic film collection and statistics systems will be established with  inventories made by the collection sites 
1560,807,Farmers  especially large scale farmers  will be required to use standard  agricultural plastic films that can be recycled and reused 
1561,807,The Program  under Results Area 2  will further support  development of a Provincial M E protocol for agricultural film collection and recycling in Jiangxi  as well as support the  implementation of the Provincial Implementation Plan for Strengthening Plastic Pollution Management in Hunan 
1563,808,32  China s livestock and poultry subsectors is a major contributor of non point sources of pollution  Animal manure 
1564,809,production amounts to nearly 4 billion tons per year in China 119 with untreated manure and wastewater from livestock  operations delivering pathogens  nutrients  nitrogen and phosphorus   heavy metals  and drugs  antibiotics  into  waterways 
1565,809,According to the Second National Pollution Source Consensus  2010   COD discharge from the Livestock and  Poultry Breeding Industry amounted to 10 01 million tons  contributing 93 76 percent of agricultural pollution  total  nitrogen and total phosphorous discharges amounted to respectively 0 60 million and 0 12 million tons  contributing 42 14  and 56 46 percent of agricultural pollution 
1566,809,Cognizant of these and other challenges within the agriculture sector  MARA  issued the 2017 Notice of Five Actions for Green Development of Agriculture  including measures for   a  improving  management of livestock manure   b  replacing chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers   c  encouraging straw  treatment   d  recycling agricultural plastic film  and  e  aquatic biodiversity protection 
1568,810,33  Collection  separation  treatment and re use or safe disposal of manure is critical for addressing these pollution  challenges  and also contributes to GHG emissions mitigation 
1569,810,The collection and separation of animal wastes  proper  disposal of treated solids and liquids  and recycling  compositing organic fertilizers  or using for waste to energy in biogas  facilities  can have significant benefits 
1570,810,The resource utilization rate of animal manure in both Hunan and Jiangxi reached  their target of 75 percent in 2020 
1571,810,Treated animal manure was mainly used as a replacement for chemical fertilizers  which  could further reduce agricultural NPS pollution   as well as for producing gas and electricity  both pathways are effective  at reducing GHG emissions relative to manure disposal in waterways or anaerobic ponds 
1572,810,The 14th Five Year Period calls  for  a  further increasing the resource utilization rate to 85 percent   b  establishing a system of animal waste treatment   processing  and returning to the field as fertilizer  and  c  attracting private financing through innovative modes  including  public private partnership and other mechanisms 
1573,810,The county level utilization ratio will be measured on farm sites as a  sub DLI  DLI 3 3   with the aim of gradually increasing the level of animal manure utilization in selected counties and  maintaining the level of utilization where it is already high  no less than 80 percent  
1574,810,This intervention will be  complemented by the development and dissemination of a provincial agricultural NPS pollution management best  practice guidelines 
1575,810,Details on county level production  utilization  and utilization target rates are presented in the full  Technical Assessment  
1576,811,34 
1577,811,During the technical consultations with stakeholders  discussions were held followed by a survey and rapid  assessment to understand the gender issues around women s participation in local river and lake management  especially 
1578,812,  117 For example  Hunan recorded a total of 83 792 tons of agricultural plastics in 2019  ranking 12th nationally and 5th in the YREB 
1579,812, 118 For example  Hunan has set a target for 80 percent recycling rate of agricultural film by the end of 2020 and almost complete recycling by 2025  with a complete agricultural film producing  selling  using  recycling  and management system established province wide

1583,814,Preliminary data  was collected from the demonstration counties and the gender results chain below has been developed based on an  analysis of the data  
1584,815,35  There are opportunities to close gender gaps in river and lake management 
1585,815,Based on data collected by the Bank  team from counties in Jiangxi and Hunan  women are underrepresented as river chiefs with a female to male ratio of 1 5   Figure 3 3  
1586,815,An extreme example is seen in Yuanling city  in which the proportion of male to female river chief is 13 to 1   In Milo County  less than 4 percent of the river cleaners are women 
1587,815,On average  7 percent of river rangers and 19 percent  of river cleaners are women 
1588,815,Considering the types of investments prioritized under the project  where women may place  greater influence on raising the public awareness and mobilizing more effective public engagement as well as  communication  the smaller number of women in these roles limit the degree to which communities internalize behavior  change on clean water and pollution control 
1589,815,In the six demonstration counties in Jiangxi  the situation is similar for civil  river chiefs and river rangers  with respectively 7 percent and 11 percent of them being women 
1590,815,However  there is a much  better gender balance for the river cleaners in Jiangxi  with about 50 percent of the work done by women  
1591,816,36  Gaps also exist at local water treatment utilities in both equal access to jobs and equal pay for the same types  of jobs 
1592,816,The rapid assessment found that women account for less than 40 percent of the technical positions and about  one third of the managerial positions 
1593,816,In addition  female staff earn a quarter less than male staff in average in Hunan   This is particularly true for women at managerial positions 
1594,816,Disaggregated data by location further shows diversity among  the utilities 
1595,816,These rural water treatment utilities reportedly have policies for equal recruitment and pay  as well as equal  training opportunities for both male and female staff 
1596,816,However  the identified issues in equal employment opportunities  and equal pay indicate gaps in the quality and implementation of these policies  which have a direct impact on the ability  of women to gain experience and participate economically in emerging job opportunities in water sector and to advance  to management positions

1601,819,The Program includes activities to address key gender gaps in women s  participation and decision making roles in both the river chief system and the wastewater utilities 
1602,819,Under Result Area 1  a  provincial level  public engagement manual is proposed to be developed for the River Chief System as an Intermediate  Indicator 
1603,819,This will include provisions to increase gender inclusion and build women s capacity to engage and serve in  citizen river chief positions  collaborate with women s organization to provide technical training  mentoring  and study  tours to women RCs and increase women s capacity and their engagement in local river management decision making 
1604,819,It  will include provisions for collaborating with women s organizations to organize public awareness campaigns on the  importance of women s contributions to river management decision making  document women s participation in public  decision making on river management and track the proportion of women as citizen river chiefs in demonstration  counties 
1605,819,Implementation of the Manual is expected to contribute to the Program s target of increasing the participation  of women from around 11 percent to 30 percent in the demonstration counties  IO5  
1606,819,These provincial level activities are  to be complemented by a basin level case study to shed further light on the basin level baseline and drivers of the gender  gap  raise awareness among Government officials within the basin on these gaps  and draw lessons to fine tune the  program actions to augment female voice and agency in the RCS system 
1607,819,Under Result Area 3  help the wastewater  management utilities in developing and implementing a gender inclusive workforce plan that includes provisions to  address obstacles in attracting  recruiting  retaining  and advancing women as part of the wastewater management  strategies to be developed by the demonstration counties under the related Disbursement Linked Indicator 
1608,819,These actions  will build on and adapt from international experience on prohibiting recruitment for male only employees  offering  affordable childcare  family leave for males as well as females  equal training opportunities for female staff  and gender  awareness training for wastewater service staff

1641,842,38  Public sector financing is justified by expected positive externalities in line with the Program s focus on public  goods 
1642,842,The Program will generate environmental benefits from reducing water pollution including reduced marine debris   providing habitat for plant and animal species  and generating global benefits through reduced GHG emissions 
1643,842,Specific  private sector actors do not capture the economic benefits of most Program outcomes  limiting the possibility for private  financing for many activities  that is  benefits are diffuse and public  
1644,842,The Program will develop institutional systems  which  will sustain and scale the activities delivering these benefits beyond the Program s life  with a focus on increasing  transparency and efficiency in achieving these outcomes relative to a  no Program  scenario 
1646,843,39  The PforR will provide value add by focusing on a subset of activities where the Government wants to enhance  efficiency  effectiveness  and impact of expenditure 
1647,843,The design of the World Bank Program  in the form of a nested  hierarchy of activities  see Section II in the main text   helps align actions of governments across levels  that is  vertically   and across jurisdictional borders  horizontally  in support of basin wide and sub basin wide outcomes  in ways that do not  always occur under traditional programming and governance arrangements 
1648,843,The World Bank s involvement will increase  central and provincial governments  exposure to international experience and best practices in integrated basin  management  water pollution control  and ecological flows and ensure lessons from recent World Bank supported  ecological restoration and water pollution control projects are incorporated into the broader Government program for  the Yangtze River Basin 
1650,844,40  This economic assessment uses a simple BCA based on benefit transfer  applied at the sub basin level for Poyang  Lake and Dongting Lake Basins 
1651,844,The assessment implicitly combines activities under Results Area 1  Results Area 2  and  Results Area 3 to value outcomes as a combined water environment quality improvement 
1652,844,Results Area 1  institutional  strengthening  is seen as facilitating outcomes achieved under Results Area 2 and Results Area 3 
1653,844,The assessment  compares a scenario of no Government program to a scenario of a Government program including World Bank support 
1654,844, This approach is used because under a PforR  Government and World Bank funds are combined to achieve results  with 
1655,845,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
1656,846,limited distinction at the activity level between World Bank financed and Government financed achievements 
1657,846,This  approach can determine whether the overall program   of which Bank financing part supports   is net socially beneficial  
1658,847,41  Expected benefits from the program will accrue at both local and global levels 
1659,847,At the local level  increases in  biodiversity and vegetative cover can be expected  together with a decrease in pollutants in major waterways and thus  periods of eutrophication  which can be expected to improve the amenity value of rivers and lakes  recreation  opportunities  real estate values  fishery productivity  shipping services  tourism  and reduced costs of water treatment 
1660,847, Global benefits will result from improved biodiversity  such as benefits to internationally migratory birds  Dongting and  Poyang Lake are important migratory bird habitats   reduced coastal eutrophication  and reduced marine plastic debris 
1661,847, Climate benefits  GHG mitigation  will be mainly derived from reduced eutrophication124 of lakes and waterways caused  by discharges of livestock waste and wastewater 
1662,847,Costs are based on total program funding over 2021 2026  which is  expected to be US 6 526 million  of which an expected US 6 126 million  93 87 percent  will be funded by the Government  and US 400 million  6 13 percent  financed by the proposed IBRD loan  see Section II C  
1663,847,Of the US 6 126 million  Government funding  it is estimated that US 2 519 million will come from Jiangxi Province and US 3 607 million will come  from Hunan Province  
1664,848,42  To estimate the program s economic benefits  benefit transfer from available environmental valuation research  in China was used 
1665,848,The economic values of water quality and ecological improvement are challenging to quantify due to  the dispersed spatial extent of benefits across the basin  the wide range  and indirect nature  of benefit types  and data  limitations 
1666,848,However  a number of studies provide benefit estimations that can be adapted to the parameters of this  program to indicate likely economic values 
1667,848,These studies utilize the contingent valuation method125  CVM  to capture the  broad range of benefits  both use and non use economic values  that are expected 
1668,848,Economic assessment at the lake basin  level considers the benefits from the program as a whole  that is  as a package of activities  within its basin areas  thus  capturing the bulk of provincial level and county level activities 
1669,848,The Program s geographic focus within Jiangxi is Poyang  Lake Basin  which covers 94 percent of the province 
1670,848,The Program s geographic focus within Hunan is Dongting Lake Basin   which covers 97 percent of the province  
1671,849,43  A survey of relevant literature found four studies well suited to comprehensively valuing water environment  improvements in river basins  Table 3 8  
1672,849,A lower bound of 0 55 percent and an upper bound of 2 9 percent for WTP as  a percentage of gross household income was found across studies for comprehensive impacts of water pollution  including  water treatment and health values  amenity values  recreational values  and ecological values  existence value to people  
1673,849, While they are broad  these attributes are similar to those expected from the present program and thus provide rough  indications of the population s comprehensive valuation  that is  including both use and non use values  of the outcomes  of the program 
1674,849,The lower identified estimate was used for a conservative approximation  0 55 percent of household  income  of the values Jiangxi and Huanan residents place on improving water quality in these two basins 
1675,849,Adjustment for  these provinces  population and per capita income levels were made and estimates compared to the total program cost   Table 3 8    
1676,850,  124 Eutrophication  caused by excessive richness of nutrients  increases the emission of methane  which is more than 25 times as potent as carbon  dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere 
1677,850, 125 Contingent valuation method uses questionnaires targeted to impacted populations to elicit their WTP for non market environmental goods   such as avoidance or reduction of pollution impacts 
1678,850,It has been applied extensively to water pollution issues

1702,864,45  A quantification of GHG net emissions is made for the PforR Program  focused on DLIs 3 1 and 3 3  Table 3 11  
1703,864, Quantification does not include emissions reductions through institutional  policy and planning measures  DLI 1 and DLI 2   although these are expected to have considerable  but difficult to quantify  emissions mitigation benefits  see para 
1704,864,47    Emissions are assessed over 15 years consistent with the economic analysis  
1705,865,  DLI 3 1  Improvements to the wastewater network is expected to prevent leakage of around 9 000 kg of COD  annually into primarily groundwater  mitigating methane emissions 
1706,865,Based on the World Bank s GHG  Accounting Tool for Water Sector Lending Projects  improvements are estimated to result in a net annual  mitigation of 25 705 tons CO2 e  
1707,866,  DLI 3 3  treatment and reuse of livestock poultry manure is expected through increased use of on farm  treatment facilities and organic fertilizer reuse  substituting for synthetic fertilizer  
1708,866,Manure treatment and  reuse is expected to be 1 048 300 tons  Hunan  and 473 100 tons  Jiangxi  due to Program activities 
1709,866,Based  on the FAO Ex ACT GHG calculation tool  and with use of a conservative nitrogen fertilizer replacement value   0 5   improvements are estimated to result in a net annual mitigation of 13 244 CO2 e

1714,869,In total  the program is expected to realize at least 0 58 million tons CO2 e in emissions mitigation over a 15  year period  with an implied value  based on a shadow price of carbon  of US  17 9 36 3 million132 over the economic  life of the Program 
1715,869,The calculations are limited to the 10 demonstration counties that are the target of the Bank s  financing  and for conservativeness does not include scale up throughout the wider government program supported by  the Program 
1717,870,47  Other elements of the Program under DLI 1 and DLI 2 are expected to have substantial GHG mitigation benefits  on top of those calculated here 
1718,870,These are challenging to quantify  and so the quantitative estimates above should be  considered a lower bound on the Program s overall GHG mitigation 
1719,870,Policies and plans implemented under DLI 2 are  expected to lead to longer term water quality improvements through reduced nutrient pollution and thus reduced  eutrophication  133 through their support for nutrient pollution mitigation  the integrated water and environment  management plan for the Gan River  
1720,870,Mitigation is also expected due to implementation of environmental water flows  under DLI 2  due to stabilized water levels that supports aquatic vegetation and mitigates methane emissions 134 DLI 1  supports data platforms that underpin water quality management and pollution control  further contributing to longer  term mitigation benefits  see para 
1721,870,37 and footnotes 77 and 78 for further detail on climate benefits    
1722,871,  132 The shadow price of carbon represents emissions  global externality value and is set at US 38 per ton  lower bound  and US 75 per ton  upper  bound  in 2017  increasing by 2 25 percent per year 
1723,871,This calculation represents the net present value  at lower and upper bound prices  of the  quantified emissions mitigation at a 6 percent discount rate  over 15 years consistent with the economic analysis

1731,873,1  Program Scope  The PforR will support a subset of activities from the Government s sub national provincial  programs for the YREB in Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces 
1732,873,The provincial plans represent the Government s program  in  conjunction with the province s 14th Five Year Plans  and contain a larger set of activities than the Bank s Program 
1733,873, Implementation of the Program will follow the existing national  provincial  and sectoral legal framework and practices for  fulfilling public financial management  public procurement  and governance responsibilities 
1734,873,The FSA provides a  comprehensive review and analysis of the current systems  identifies risks  and recommends mitigation measures for  implementation to enhance the performance of the current systems in meeting the Program objectives 
1735,873,This annex  summarizes the main conclusions of the FSA  
1736,874,2  Assessment of Fiduciary Systems  There is no difference between government program and the Program financed  by the Bank regarding geographic boundary 
1737,874,In Jiangxi  the Program covers about 100 counties included in the River Basin  Eco Compensation Mechanism for the  5 Rivers 1 Lake  Plan  in Hunan  the Program covers about the same number of  counties included in the Integrated Water Environment Management Plan for Dongting Lake Basin 
1738,874,The FSA assessed the  public financial management system and the public procurement system of key program implementing agencies and their  line agencies 
1739,874,These agencies include but not limited to  at provincial level  Finance Bureau  FB   Development and Reform  Commission  DRC   Department of Environment and Ecology  DEE   Department of Water Resources  DWR   Department  of Agriculture and Rural Affaires  DARA   and Provincial Audit Office  PAO   and at county level  Water Resource Bureau   WRB   Housing and Construction Bureau  HCB   Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau  ARAB   of four counties in Hunan  and six counties in Jiangxi 
1740,874, The assessment covers the review of the PFM cycle  Program systems and capacity  improvements  and the Program implementation support  
1741,875,3  The assessment concludes that the Program s fiduciary systems are adequate for meeting Bank s PforR Policy and  Directive requirements 
1742,875,The systems can reasonably assure that the Program s financing proceeds will be used for the  intended purposes  with due attention to the principles of economy  efficiency  effectiveness  transparency  and  accountability 
1744,876,4  Public Financial Management System 
1745,876,The Budget Law of the People s Republic of China  PRC   issued in 2015  and revised in 2018  has set the budget management framework for the central government and local governments at all  levels in China 
1746,876,Jiangxi Province integrated fiscal transfers from the central government  budgetary funds from local  governments and the market  and established Jiangxi s River Basin Ecological Compensation Fund since 2016  the Program  the Bank will finance  
1747,876, The budget quota of compensation fund is distributed to city
1748,876,ounty government in two tranches 
1749,876,  The first tranche which mainly comes from central government transfers is distributed in advance at the end of the  previous year  and the second one mainly from provincial government is normally delivered in the second half of the  current year 
1750,876, The city
1751,876,ounty government used to integrate the first tranche in their annual government budget  but the  treatment of the second tranche is various 
1752,876, Some counties included the second tranche in their annual budget based on  the projection and made adjustment later on  while others just waited the distribution of budget quota 
1753,876, In Hunan province  a program called  Dongting Lake Water Environment Comprehensive Treatment Program  has been approved by the State  Council with total estimated budget of CNY 59 18 billion covering the period from 2018 2025 
1754,876, However  program budget  was not prepared  and no clear funding sources were identified for each program activity 
1755,876,Instead  sectoral departments  were required to integrate various available financing sources 
1756,876, In addition  some of the upper level transferring funds are  distributed to counties in the form of general budget rather than ear marked budget  and counties are playing essential  roles in deciding how to use the program funds although central and provincial government set up the requirement on  minimized percentage of using transferring funds on program activities 
1758,877,5  Per the county s self reporting in 45 counties of Jiangxi province  the average utilization rate of the program funds  was 90 67  in the past three years 
1759,877, Through analyzing the final accounts in Hunan province for the past three years it is 
1760,878,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
1761,879,noted that Hunan used about CNY 24 34 billion on water environmental management from the year 2018 to 2020  roughly  matching the total allocated budget  indicating program activities were mostly implemented as planned 
1762,879, Governments at  all levels have integrated all financial funds into the treasury single account  TSA  system 
1763,879,All revenues are directly  collected into the treasury account or the special financial account  and all expenditures are paid to the  contractors suppliers beneficiaries through the TSA   
1764,880,6  Since program is not a budget classification element  it is hard to trace the program expenditures from the existing  Government treasury system 
1765,880,In Hunan Province  the counties receiving program funds are not required to report program  expenditures regularly to upper level government 
1766,880,In Jiangxi Province  although government decree requires that county  government report to PDRC and PFD about its program expenditures annually  such requirement has not been strictly  implemented always 
1767,880, As a result  program expenditures are not properly monitored and managed at provincial level    
1768,881,7  There is adequate control over  and stewardship  of program funds  with well defined delegation of authority 
1769,881, Following the national policy and regulations issued by the MOF and NDRC  the provincial governments have issued a  series of regulations regarding fund management  implementation measures  and result verification procedures  and so  on 
1770,881, Based on the interviews on counties visited  it was noted that internal audit function had not been widely established  within county budgetary units  however  the supervision and performance evaluation unit  the unit responsible for the  internal audit  within county finance bureau sometimes carried out its supervision on the usage of compensation funds 
1772,882,8 
1773,882,Although government auditors indeed audit program funds when they carry out budget execution audit   accountability audit and other types of audits  no specific audit was conducted by provincial audit offices  PAOs  and audit  offices of interviewed counties on the usage of program funds in the past years 
1774,882, The audit of the proposed Program will  be conducted by the provincial audit offices 
1775,882,Besides conducting the audit on budget execution and other provincial level  entities  the PAOs have been the auditors of World Bank financed projects in two provinces for about three decades 
1776,882,They  are the auditors the Bank accepted in China  The first year s audit report issued by the PAOs is subject to the quality review  by the China National Audit Office  CNAO   
1777,883,9  Public Procurement System  TBL and GPL are the primary public procurement laws governing public procurement  in China 
1778,883,TBL focuses on construction related works  goods  and consulting services  while GPL focuses on fiscal budget  funds financed purchasing activities carried out by government departments  institutions  and organizations 
1779,883,The  demarcation line is not very clear between the two until the issuance of monetary threshold135 for tendering and bidding  activities by NDRC and guidance documents by the MOF  NDRC  and respective line ministries 
1780,883,Each province and line  ministry issue procurement related guidance and orders to regulate procurement in its respective administrative  jurisdiction or sector 
1781,883,Though fragmented  there s no conflict with the two laws 
1782,883,Anti corruption requirements and  measures are available in laws and regulations to prevent  report  detect  investigate  prosecute  and sanction fraud and  corruption conducts  
1783,884,10 
1784,884,The assessment analyzed data  interviewed  and discussed in person with procuring entities and public transaction  centers  mandated by government for providing service and supervision to purchasing activities through open and  selective bidding  on procurement legal framework implementation in practice 
1785,884,It identifies no deviations from the legal  requirements    
1786,885,11 
1787,885,The key stakeholders of procurement under the Program are line government agencies  procuring entity   procurement agent  design institute  supervisor  transaction center and the selected supplier   contractor   consultant 
1788,885, The line government agencies plan and get approval the activities to be carried out under the Program  the procurement  agent assist the procuring entity  government agency itself or its delegated agencies  to prepare procurement documents  and facilitate the procurement process  design institute provides technical contribution to the procurement process   supervisor monitors contract implementation  transaction center provides service to procurement process and supervises

1790,887,the process simultaneously  the selected supplier   contractor   consultant implements the contract as agreed with the  employer   purchaser   client   
1791,888,12  A complaint mechanism is provided in both TBL and GPL  Complainant has the right to file a complaint with the  procuring entity or supervising authority of the procuring entity 
1792,888,GPL further allows administrative reconsideration or  administrative proceeding to the People s court in case the complainant is unsatisfied with the resolution or any delay  handling of the case by the supervising authority of the procuring entity 
1794,889,13  Key Conclusions and Recommendations 
1795,889,A comprehensive PFM framework has been established including  government regulations  decrees  standards  and procedures  and so on which regulate the program activities to ensure  program funds are used for the intended purposes 
1796,889, However  the enforcement is various at different places and the  Bank s involvement could strengthen the institutional capacity of related government entities 
1797,889, Given Program is not an  element for budget classification in China  which brings challenges on most PFM areas 
1798,889, During the fiduciary assessment   the major financial management risks have been identified and mitigation measures provided  
1799,890, a  The financing sources of the program is quite comprehensive as it integrates funds from very broad sources  and some of them are one time compensation funds 
1800,890, Multiple year program budgeting should be prepared  to ensure program funds could be secured and county government could prioritize its investment to enhance  the efficiency of its scarce financing resources 
1802,891, b  Budget quota was distributed to counties
1803,891,ities in batches and some program funds were delivered in the  second half year or even the year end which prevents the county government from including the entire  program funds in its annual budget and delays the implementation of planned activities 
1804,891, Provincial entities  should revisit their budget quota distribution and take actions to ensure the budget quota could be  distributed to county
1805,891,ity in advance  
1806,892, c   Program  is not a budget classification element in China and the required Program financial reporting can t  be generated from government treasury system 
1807,892, A blue tagging mechanism which can trace program  expenditures from government existing integrated financial management system has been recommended  and it is expected to be piloted  especially in those demonstration counties  during project implementation 
1808,892, This also creates fundamental basis for generating program financial reporting from the Government  treasury system  
1809,893, d  No requirement by provincial government on reporting of program expenditures in Hunan province and the  reporting requirement stipulated in government decrees were not strictly implementation in Jiangxi  province 
1810,893,A tailored program financial reporting templet will be designed which can capture the data from  government system and used by the project upon agreed by related government entities  
1811,894, e  Absence of efficient supervision by related provincial entities on the usage of program funds may bring  potential risk of improper use of program funds 
1812,894, The decrees about program expenditure supervision should  be established in Hunan province 
1813,894, Provincial entities involved should strengthen the supervision on program  funds in line with related government decrees  
1814,895, f  Government auditors did not audit the program funds and prepare the program audit report 
1815,895, The Bank will  work with the Provincial Audit Offices  PAO  to develop the terms of reference  TOR  for program auditing  to ensure program funds could be audited in line with the Bank s policy    
1816,896,14 
1817,896,The Program has a robust legal framework for procurement  which includes the Tendering and Bidding Law of  1999  the Government Procurement law of 2003  and regulations and orders issued at national  provincial  and county  levels 
1818,896,Although the laws could be modernized and aligned to modern principles such as  value for money  and  fit for 
1819,897,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
1820,898,purpose   both offer a fair playing field for bidders and promote transparency and competitiveness  Four major  procurement risks have been identified and mitigation measures provided  
1821,899, a  Contracts may be awarded to firms or individuals that are debarred or under temporary suspension by the  World Bank or other multilateral development banks 
1822,899,The following mitigation measures are proposed   i   upon Program loan effectiveness  the Provincial Program Office shall issue a high level official letter or official  instruction to require Program implementation agencies  PIAs  to ensure that no contract will be awarded  to ineligible firms or individuals   ii  procurement staff at the Provincial Program Office are to check the latest  list of debarred and temporarily suspended firms and individuals136 before contract award to ensure that  contract being awarded to eligible firms or individuals only  and  iii  the TOR for the annual external audit  shall include the task of randomly selecting contracts and assessing whether they have been awarded to an  ineligible firm or individual 
1824,900, b  The World Bank may not be informed of fraud allegations and corruption issues during implementation 
1825,900,A  Program Implementation Plan  PIP  shall therefore require the client to inform the World Bank of any  credible and material allegations of fraud and any corruption issues as part of the Program progress reports   as mandated in the Loan Agreement 
1827,901, c  In Jiangxi  the Price Commitment Method is widely used for bid evaluation by using the cost estimate as a  key reference for contract price determination 
1828,901,To avoid substantial deviation between contract price and  the prevailing market price level  the PMO is required to regularly update the cost estimate by taking account  of market variants in a timely manner to ensure realistic value for money is being achieved 
1830,902, d  Contracts may not be completed within the contractual completion time  and the contract completion audit  may not be completed in a timely manner 
1831,902,Human  financial and policy resources should be allocated by  Hunan and Jiangxi PDRCs for close monitoring contract implementation progress to minimize or avoid  foreseeable cost overruns and or implementation delays 
1833,903,Table 4 1  Program Fiduciary Systems Risks and Mitigation Measures  
1834,904,The contracts may be awarded to firms or individuals which are  debarred or under temporary suspension by the World Bank or other  multilateral development banks  
1835,905,PAP   1  The PDRC shall  upon Program loan effectiveness  issue a high  level official letter or official instruction to implementation agencies to  ensure that no contract will be awarded to ineligible firms or  individuals 
1836,905, 2  One of the duties of the procurement staff at the Hunan  and Jiangxi PMO will be to check the latest World Bank lists of the  debarred and temporarily suspended firms and individuals before  contract award to ensure that contracts are awarded to eligible firms or  individuals 
1837,905, 3  The TOR for annual external audit includes the task of  randomly selecting awarded contracts to check whether they have  been awarded to ineligible firms or individuals  
1838,906,The World Bank may not be informed of any credible and material  allegations of fraud and corruption during the implementation of the  Program  
1839,907,PAP  The PPMO shall regularly inform the World Bank of any credible  and material allegations of fraud and corruption in the Program  progress report  as required in the Loan Agreement and the Program  Agreement 
1841,908,The financing sources of the Program are quite comprehensive   integrating funds from very broad sources  and some of them are  one time compensation funds  budget quota was distributed to  counties
1842,908,ities in batches and some Program funds were delivered in 
1843,909,PIP  Multiple year program budgeting should be prepared to ensure  Program funds could be secured and the county government could  prioritize its investment to enhance the efficiency of its scarce financing  resources  provincial entities should revisit their budget quota

1847,912,distribution and take actions to ensure the budget quota could be  distributed to the county
1848,912,ity in advance  
1849,913, Program  is not a budget classification element in China and the  required Program financial reporting cannot be generated from the  Government treasury system  
1850,914,PIP  A blue tagging mechanism which can trace Program expenditures  from the Government s existing integrated FM system has been  recommended and it is expected to be piloted during project  implementation  especially in those demonstration counties 
1851,914,Provincial  finance departments will decide when and how to implement this  piloting by considering the readiness of government reform on the  integrated financial management information system   
1852,915,No requirement by provincial government on reporting of program  expenditures in Hunan Province and the reporting requirement  stipulated in government decrees were not strictly implementation  in Jiangxi Province 
1853,915,Absence of efficient supervision by related  provincial entities on the usage of Program funds may bring potential  risk of improper use of program funds  
1854,916,PIP  Related decrees on Program expenditure supervision should be set  up in Hunan Province 
1855,916,Provincial entities involved should strengthen the  supervision on Program funds in line with related Government decrees 
1856,916, Guidance and training should be provided on supervision and  performance evaluation unit as they are performing the internal audit  function  
1857,917,Government auditors did not audit the Program funds and prepared  the Program audit report   
1858,918,The World Bank will work with the PAOs to develop the TOR for  program auditing to ensure Program funds could be audited in line with  the World Bank s policy   
1859,919,In Jiangxi  the most common procurement method is the Price  Commitment Method 
1860,919,The Price Commitment Method displays the  procurement principles of being open  fair  and transparent but it is  questionable as to whether it offers value for money as the price is  predetermined and bidders can t offer a lower price 
1862,920,PAP  For value for money to be achieved  it is critical that the cost  estimating process is robust and that unit prices are regularly updated  to ensure the cost estimate is as accurate as possible  
1863,921,Based on the analyses of the contract administration  most contracts  were completed within the contractual period 
1864,921,However  55 out of  272 contracts  20 2 percent  in Hunan and 58 out of 254 contracts   22 8 percent  in Jiangxi could not be completed within the  contractual completion time  the longest delay was one year 
1865,921,Some  contract completion audit could not be conducted on time  
1866,922,PIP  Procedures or a guidance note should be produced by Hunan and  Jiangxi PDRCs that clearly define the undertaking of contract  administration responsibilities in line with the domestic regulatory  framework 
1868,923,15  Program Implementation Support  Proposed fiduciary implementation support includes the following  
1869,924,  Review Program implementation progress  including achievement of Program results and PAP implementation  
1870,925,  Assess timeliness and adequacy of Program fund appropriation as approved in the budget   
1871,926,  Continuously assess and monitor the performance of the FM and procurement systems under the Program and  provide suggestions for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness  
1872,927,  Monitor performance of the fiduciary systems and the audit report  including the implementation of the PAP   
1873,928,  Monitor the PforR financial statement reporting process and assist the client as necessary  
1874,929,  Monitor the contracts implementation  including cost  time  and quality control  
1875,930,  Help the client resolve implementation issues and carry out institutional capacity building  
1876,931,  Assist the CNAO and the audit offices at the provincial and county levels in strengthening audit arrangements  
1877,932,  Hold regular trainings for provincial and county audit offices  particularly with respect to procurement post  audit to build capacity  
1878,933,  Monitor changes in fiduciary risks of the Program and  as relevant  compliance with the fiduciary provisions of  legal covenants  
1879,934,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
1880,935,  1  The Program will support improvement in water and ecological quality in river and lake basins in Jiangxi and Hunan  and is thus expected to bring overall E S benefits 
1881,935,The implementation of activities under the Program will rely on the  existing national and provincial legal framework and institutional system for managing E S issues 
1882,935,The ESSA provides a  comprehensive review of relevant E S risk systems and procedures and tracking of performance in China nationally  and  in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces  and recommends necessary actions to address the identified gaps as well as opportunities  to enhance E S performance during implementation 
1883,935,This annex summarizes the main conclusions of ESSA  
1884,936,2  Potential Environmental and Social Effects 
1885,936,An E S risk screening was conducted for the Program supported  activities  during ESSA preparation  and concluded that the overall E S risk rating of this Program is Substantial  
1886,937,3 
1887,937,The Program will support pollution control and ecological restoration activities including construction and  upgrading of county and township wastewater treatment plants and pipelines  agricultural plastics collection and recycle   waste treatment of existing livestock farms  and institutional and capacity building activities 
1888,937,These activities will generate  E S benefits of reduced pollutant discharge to water bodies and improved river and lake water quality and basin ecological  environment 
1889,937,Activities with the potential to cause significant adverse impacts on the environment and or people are  excluded  including activities that  a  involve closure or relocation of livestock  poultry  or aquaculture farming   b  involve  large scale infrastructure construction   c  have substantial impacts on river hydrology and ecology  and  d  involve the  allocation or conveyance of water  including inter basin water transfers or other activities  resulting in significant changes  to water quality or availability 
1890,937,The ESSA has formulated an E S exclusion list   
1891,938,4 
1892,938,The main adverse E S impacts include construction related impacts such as dust  noise  disturbance of water  body  soil erosion  wastewater and solid waste management  construction worker and community s health and safety   labor management  small scale of land acquisition  temporary land use  and potential impacts to vulnerable groups   impacts during operation such as effluent discharge from wastewater treatment facilities  safe operation of facilities   workers  health and safety  safe application of fertilizers  and impacts on farmers  livelihood  and also the potential  downstream indirect impacts of TA activities 
1893,938,These adverse E S impacts are not significant and can be well identified and  readily avoided  minimized  and mitigated through mature technologies and good management practices 
1894,938,Neither OP BP  7 50 International Waterways nor OP BP 7 60 Disputed Areas are applicable to the Program  
1895,939,5  Assessment of Environmental and Social Management System 
1896,939,A comprehensive review of the legal and  regulatory framework for E S management relevant to the activities supported under the PforR was conducted  including  institutional arrangements  management procedures and their implementation  institutional capacity  and performance 
1898,940,6 
1899,940,Overall  China has established a comprehensive system for the management of E S issues at both national and  provincial levels  including Jiangxi and Hunan provinces   which consists of laws  regulations  guidelines  specifications   and standards principally consistent with the World Bank s PforR Policy and Directive 
1900,940,This system provides a reasonable  basis for addressing the E S issues related to activities supported under the PforR  
1901,941,7  Environmental Management System 
1902,941,Since the promulgation of its first Environmental Protection Law in 1979   China has gradually established a comprehensive environmental management legal framework  becoming one of the  region s most dynamic environmental law frameworks 
1903,941,In recent years  the Government of China has worked to reform  its environmental management system by enhancing its law enforcement and prevention approach 
1904,941,A set of laws   regulations  and technical guidelines have been or are in the process of being issued or updated by national and local  governments regarding EIA for construction projects and OHS management 
1906,942,8 
1907,942,The key PforR government stakeholders involved in environmental  health  and safety management include  various levels of ecology and environment bureau  EEB   health commission  emergency management bureau   construction bureau  water resource bureau  and agriculture and rural affairs bureau 
1908,942,The EEB is responsible for reviewing 
1909,943,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
1910,944,and approving the EIA documents and supervising the environmental compliance of activities under this PforR during the  construction and operation phases  the water resource bureau reviews and approves the projects  water and soil  conservation reports  the emergency management bureau and health commission take overall responsibility of OHS  management  the construction bureau has sector management authority for wastewater and solid waste projects  and  the agriculture and rural affairs bureau supervises the activities involving fertilizer  agricultural plastics  and livestock  waste 
1912,945,9 
1913,945,Consultations of government departments at provincial  county  township  and village levels and site visits to  typical projects in selected counties of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces  have demonstrated that the domestic environmental  management systems  implementation mechanisms  and institutional arrangements related to the Program activities are  principally consistent with the World Bank s PforR Policy and Directive and can provide a generally effective management  framework for the implementation of the Program activities 
1914,945,The assessment results also indicate inadequacies in the  implementation of some environmental management systems  mainly including weak environmental protection and  participation awareness of farmers in chemical fertilizer reduction and agricultural plastics recycling  and inadequate OHS  training for contracted and temporary workers involved in the waste collection activities 
1916,946,10  Social Management System 
1917,946,The assessment concludes that China has formulated a series of laws and policies at  the national and local levels and has established appropriate management agencies and mechanisms to govern social risks  in relation to the Program s activities 
1918,946,Subject to the potential social impacts and risks identified  the social system  assessment focused on the dimensions concerning social impacts and risks assessment and management system  cultural  heritage protection  occupational health and community safety  land acquisition and resettlement  public participation   ethnic minorities  and vulnerable groups 
1919,946,The social systems are deemed comprehensive and consistent with the World  Bank PforR Policy and Directive  
1920,947,11 
1921,947,Jiangxi and Hunan have established management agencies with clear responsibilities and qualified staff at the  provincial  municipal  and county levels for managing corresponding social risks and impacts 
1922,947,The ESSA report assessed  the organizational setup of relevant social authorities against the principles and elements as set out in the World Bank  Guidance 
1923,947,For example  China has established a functioning mechanism of Social Stability Risk Assessment  which is  implemented by related project implementation agencies and managed through the committees of provincial and county  political and legislative affairs of related regional governments 
1924,947,The cultural departments are responsible for managing  adverse impacts on physical cultural heritage 
1925,947,The natural resource bureaus enforce land acquisition  compensation  and  resettlement with the support of and coordination by township governments and village committees 
1926,947,Other line bureaus   such as social security bureaus  labor bureaus  among others  are also to be involved in the process of livelihood  restoration for project affected persons 
1927,947,China has set up various competent authorities to manage to support and  assistance to different vulnerable groups 
1928,947,For example  poverty reduction offices or countryside revitalization bureaus are  mainly responsible for poverty reduction  disabled person federation for assistance to disabled people  civil affairs bureaus  for support to left behind old people and children  and women s federations for assistance to women 
1930,948,12 
1931,948,During the preparation  the engagement with various stakeholders from both provincial and county levels  and  the solid due diligence of relevant prior similar projects  concluded that the social management systems are well  functioning in line with the regulations and that the overall social outcomes in similar domestic projects are fairly good 
1932,948, However  the assessment also identified some minor gaps for further improvement to enhance social impacts  including   a  strengthening the recording and documentation for the processes of social risk screening  public consultation and  information disclosure process  and grievance redress mechanism  GRM  operation   b  extending the physical and  occupational health examinations to contract workers or and temporary workers  and  c  establishing monitoring  mechanism for social risk management of World Bank financed activities 
1934,949,13  Consultation and Information Disclosure 
1935,949,Despite the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic  the team explored  various means  both face to face and virtual  to meaningfully engage with relevant stakeholders  following the World 
1936,950,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
1937,951,Bank s latest guidance notes137 on public consultation in response to the outbreak 
1938,951,Relevant stakeholders  including line  government departments  enterprise representatives  the workers  and local communities  were consulted in the process  through meetings and field visits to selected counties 
1939,951,The draft ESSA report was shared with Jiangxi and Hunan PPMO  and selected counties  six counties of Dayu  Chongyi  Yugan  Yongfeng  Fuliang  and Yudu in Jiangxi and four counties of  Shimen  Ziyang  Miluo  and Yuanling in Hunan  and consultation workshops were carried out with the key stakeholders at  provincial and county levels 
1940,951,The participants voiced their support in implementing the proposed Program and concurred  with the findings and recommendations of the draft ESSA  which were considered relevant and valuable for strengthening  the actual effectiveness of the implementation of the existing E S system 
1941,951,Some participants provided valuable opinions  to improve the accuracy of the ESSA description in local context  which have been reflected in the revised ESSA 
1942,951,The draft  ESSA has been disclosed on the World Bank s website on November 1  2021  on the provincial website in Jiangxi on October  27  2021 and Hunan on November 04  2021  
1943,952,14  Key Conclusions and Recommendations 
1944,952,The assessment concluded that although the national and provincial  system for addressing E S impacts is principally consistent with the World Bank s PforR Policy and Directive  opportunities  do exist for strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of E S risk management under the Program 
1945,952,The key  recommendations are as follows  
1946,953, a  Provide training on chemical fertilizer use and agricultural waste management to farmers 
1947,953,The provincial   and county  agriculture and rural affairs bureau should develop relevant training programs  prepare training  materials  and conduct trainings during Program implementation 
1948,953,Meanwhile  subsidy and incentive  mechanisms are suggested  where appropriate  
1949,954, b  Hunan provincial  and county  agriculture and rural affairs bureau should establish a sustainable incentive  mechanism to increase the collection rate of agricultural plastics  in which the existing jobholders should be  appropriately considered  for example  the village cleaners 
1951,955, c  Enhance the OHS management of the enterprises involved in the Program activities 
1952,955,For jobs with potential  occupational hazards  take such measures as occupational hazard identification and pre job  on the job  and  post job health checkup 
1953,955,Strengthen OHS training for contracted and temporary workers  including  emergency response and proper use of personal protective equipment   
1954,956, d  Establish a social impacts and risks screening  public participation  monitoring  and reporting mechanism 
1955,956, The PIAs shall monitor and record the implementation of social impacts and risks  including land acquisition  and resettlement impacts  support for vulnerable groups  and so on  screening  mitigation measures  implementation  information disclosure  public participation  and GRM 
1956,956,Disclose to the public the hotlines  and contacts of GRM and establish an effective external communication mechanism  
1957,957,15  To implement these recommendations  three actions are included in the PAP  
1958,958, a  Provincial and county agriculture and rural affairs bureaus shall provide trainings on chemical fertilizer use  and agricultural waste management to farmers  
1959,959, b  The PIAs shall strengthen OHS training and regular health checkups for all in service workers  including  temporary workers  
1960,960, c  The PIAs shall establish a social impacts and risks screening  public participation  monitoring  and reporting  mechanism and strengthen information and record management in social risk management

2053,1002,6 
2054,1002,The cost table for the Central Basin IPF prepared by NDRC CWRC has been reviewed by MoF who have confirmed  up to CNY 48 million equivalent to be financed through the IBRD loan as part of the YRPERP 
2055,1002,However  the actual amount  during implementation will be based on the annual workplans agreed with the World Bank  and further reviewed through  internal government budget processes  
2056,1003,7  The Central Basin IPF component focuses on Type II TA activities and would have broad E S benefits 
2057,1003,The Central  Basin IPF aims at promoting cross sectoral coordination and inter jurisdictional cooperation toward the common goals of  improving water quality and ecological protection in the Yangtze River Basin 
2058,1003,The Program s Central Basin IPF primarily  consists of TA activities with regard to Yangtze River Basin water and environmental protection  including investigation  and traceability of water pollution  inter correlation of water ecosystems  case studies of systematic environmental  protection and restoration  ecological protection incentive programs  and related capacity building and international  knowledge exchange activities 
2060,1004,8  The Central Basin IPF could have substantial downstream environmental risks and impacts 
2061,1004,The Central Basin IPF  is not anticipated to support any physical activities  directly draft policies or regulations  or support feasibility  studies technical designs for future investment projects 
2062,1004,Therefore  implementation of this central component is not likely  to cause any direct adverse environmental impacts but may involve significant stakeholder engagement and public  consultation 
2063,1004,The Central Basin IPF potentially has indirect impacts related to the implementation of the products or  outcomes of the TA activities 
2064,1004,For example  there could be construction operation nuisance and community health and  safety risks from civil works of physical investment projects following the TA recommendations  such as wastewater and  solid waste collection and treatment facilities  sampling and monitoring stations  ecological remediation and river lake  connection works  and so on 
2065,1004,Studies aiming to reduce pollutants  for example  phosphorus and plastic waste  released in  the river basin may have downstream implications on resource efficiency and pollution management  such as  relocation shutting down upgrading of industrial enterprises  reduced use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides   agricultural and industrial water efficiency improvement  and control and disposal of hazardous chemicals  agricultural  wastes  and plastic wastes 
2066,1004,The studies will also need to consider and assess potential impacts on aquatic life  water rights   water uses  ecosystem services and broader implications from the perspectives of hydrology  climate change   sedimentation  urbanization  and industrialization 
2067,1004,Meanwhile  there could be a risk of communicable disease  transmission caused by people gathering for trainings  workshops  meetings  and so on  particularly given the context of  the COVID 19 pandemic 
2069,1005,9  The Central Basin IPF could have substantial downstream social risks and impacts 
2070,1005,Implementing the Central Basin  IPF itself would have moderate social risks  mainly related to health and safety for field workers and meaningful 
2071,1006,  The World Bank   Yangtze River Protection and Ecological Restoration Program  P171644  
2072,1007,stakeholder engagement 
2073,1007,However  adopting and enforcing the study outputs could have potentially significant  downstream social changes among relevant communities  enterprises  institutions  and vulnerable groups  such as ethnic  minorities  the workers  farmers  and so on  through regulating land and resources use and constructing and operating  physical facilities to improve water quality and improve ecological environment  and so on 
2074,1007,The ESMF identified the  potential downstream social risks  including labor risks  community health and safety  restriction on land use   resettlement  and exclusion risks for vulnerable groups 
2075,1007,Exclusion risks would potentially relate to livelihood impact to  farmers by limiting land use and inadequate consultations with ethnic minorities  and livelihood impacts to workers  potentially experiencing layoff  among others 
2077,1008,10  An ESMF and an SEF have been prepared for the Central Basin IPF consistent with the ESF 
2078,1008,The ESMF screened the  potential E S risks and established the principles  procedures  and requirements for managing the underlying E S risks  and impacts of the TA activities 
2079,1008,The SEF differentiated the roles and responsibilities for CPMO and TA implementing  agencies regarding effective stakeholder engagement throughout the process of TA studies 
2080,1008,Both the ESMF and SEF  provide operational guidance for applying relevant ESSs to TA activities and creating added value for enhancing the  operationality of policy recommendations while incorporating solid considerations on significant E S risks 
2082,1009,11  The material actions have been agreed with the borrower and committed in the ESCP 
2083,1009,The ESCP commits the  CPMO  the expert advisory panel  and the TA implementing agencies  that is  Executing Agencies and any additional  contractors for TA activities  to ensure adequate assistance is mobilized from E S experts

2161,1030, Request for Bids and Request for Quotations  may be more suitable for the procurement of goods and non consulting services contracts depending on the contract cost  estimate 
2162,1030,Direct Selection will be adopted if and when fully justified   
2163,1031,27  Project Procurement Strategy for Development  PPSD  and Procurement Plan  PP  
2164,1031,Based on paragraphs 4 1  4 5 of the World Bank s Procurement Regulations  a PPSD and an accompanying project PP have been prepared by the  CPMO in close consultation with the World Bank 
2165,1031,The PPSD states how procurement activities will help the project achieve  its development objective and deliver best value for money using the fit for purpose procurement and risk managed  approach  giving due consideration to specific project needs and to the country s operational and market context 
2166,1031, Decisions on the selection methods and market approaches to be adopted in the project PP are justified in the PPSD 
2167,1031,This  information will be made available in the project s database  on the World Bank s external website  and at the project  implementing agency s office 
2168,1031,The PP will be updated in a way that reflects actual implementation needs and institutional  capacity and will be agreed upon by the World Bank through STEP 
2169,1031,The PPSD may need to be updated during project  implementation   
2170,1032,28  Use of STEP 
2171,1032,It is mandatory that all procurement transactions for post  and prior review contracts under the  project be recorded in and processed through STEP  the World Bank s planning and tracking system
