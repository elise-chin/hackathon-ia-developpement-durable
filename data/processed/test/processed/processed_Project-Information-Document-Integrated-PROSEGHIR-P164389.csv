14,14,The review did authorize the team to appraise and negotiate       
15,15,  1  Mexico is an upper middle income country with a diversified economy  but moderate economic growth  has limited significant poverty reduction and income convergence 
16,15,Growth averaged about 2 percent between  1980 and 2018  or close to 1 percent on a per capita basis  The country s per capita gross domestic product  GDP   stands at 34 percent of U S 
17,15,per capita GDP  compared with 49 percent back in 1980  On average  over the last 25  years  total factor productivity  TFP  growth has been negative 
18,15,The official multidimensional poverty rate fell from  44 4 percent of the population in 2016 to 41 9 percent in 2018  while the share of the population living below the  monetary poverty line in 2018 was 48 8 percent  close to the level observed in 2008 
19,15,Moreover  regional inequality  is high 
20,15, After a decline in 2010 14  the annualized growth rate of median per capita income was 1 8 percent in  2016 18  still well below the average in the Latin America and the Caribbean  LAC  region      2 
21,15,Public investment has been low  and the gaps in infrastructure have been widening over the last 30  years  hampering broad based income growth 
22,15,Public investment reached an average of only 3 2 percent of GDP  between 2008 and 2015 1 Excluding Pemex  the share would be only 1 7 percent of GDP in average over the last  years 
23,15,This falls short of rapidly growing Latin American countries and emerging economies that spend above 5  percent of GDP in this area 
24,15, Gaps have been widening across sectors  including transport  energy  housing and  urban infrastructure  and water      3 
25,15,Water infrastructure is particularly affected by underinvestment with highly negative potential  consequences to the welfare of the population and the economy 
26,15, More than 35 million Mexicans have limited  access to water or receive low quality water services 
27,15, More than a hundred of the country s 731 watersheds face  severe shortages  and the number of overexploited aquifers tripled between 1975 and 2013 2 Overall  water  availability per capita has reduced drastically  from 18 035 to 3 982 m3 inhabitant per year between 1950 and  2013 
28,15,      4  The deceleration in economic activity underway since Q2 2018 continued in 2019  but Mexico maintains  a prudent macroeconomic policy framework 
29,15,On the demand side  despite real wage growth and strong  remittance inflows in 2019  private consumption growth dipped to its slowest pace in the last years 
30,15,Dragged by  wage and other recurrent spending cuts in public administration  government consumption also slowed  significantly over the first half of 2019 
31,15,A degree of uncertainty around the trajectory of some of the new 
32,16,  1 Infralatam    2 Overexploited aquifers  where groundwater provides more than 65 percent of the volume required by cities  increased from 32 in 1975  to 126 in 2013  out of a total of 653

35,19,administration s sectoral policies  slowed investment further  which had been weak since 2016 
36,19,In this context   inflation pressures continue to subside even with the significant minimum wage increase enacted at the beginning  of the year 
37,19, The policy rate has helped the local currency to hover below 20 pesos per dollar  as Mexico remains  attractive to portfolio investors  but with less positive effects for fixed capital formation 
38,19,Fiscal consolidation  enabled the achievement of public debt stabilization 
39,19, Mexico led emerging markets in stabilizing and then  reducing public debt as a share of GDP  which stood at 53 6 percent in 2018 for gross public sector debt  44 9  percent on a net basis as reported by the government  
40,19,Expenditure rationalization measures plus the use its  revenue stabilization fund broadly enable the authorities to compensate for lower than expected revenue  collection during 2019 
41,19,Adherence to fiscal prudence is expected to continue as the administration presented its  2020 budget with a primary surplus and an overall fiscal deficit in line with the objective of stabilizing the public  debt to GDP ratio 
42,19,The budget emphasizes categorical social programs  minimum pension  student grants and  stipends for youth  and a moderate public investment increase  which are financed by program consolidation and  cuts in public wages  goods and services  and discretionary transfers to states 
44,20,5  Water stress is a critical vulnerability for Mexico  including in the context of climate change 
45,20,As the  country s population has grown  water availability per capita has fallen sharply  dropping from 18 035 m3 per  year in 1950 to 3 392 m3 per year in 2015 
46,20,The National Water Commission  Comisi n Nacional del Agua   CONAGUA  projects that water resources per capita will reach 3 250 m3 by 2030 3 More than 35 million Mexicans  have limited access to water or receive low quality water services 
47,20,Moreover  rising global temperatures and  shifting precipitation patterns are already affecting the country s hydrological cycles  and the increasing strain on  the country s scarce water resources is leading to the overexploitation of groundwater and productivity losses 
48,20, Groundwater provides more than 65 percent of all water used by Mexican cities 
49,20,Pumping out underground  water causes land subsidence  or sinking   which makes flooding worse and significant structural damages to  urban infrastructures 
50,20,For example  subsidence levels  sinking  in Mexico City are observed over 30 centimeters  per year   The economic costs of water depletion and degradation have increased over the last 15 years    
51,21,6  The water sector would require significant  innovative and complex investments  together with  increased institutional capacity  to provide water with sustainability to the population 
52,21,Limited investment in  key water management infrastructure is exposing Mexico to higher climate and non climatic related risks while  increasing opportunity costs of underinvestment 
53,21,Mexico has a large network of dams with 150km3 stored in 667  facilities 
54,21,However  many of them were built more than 50 years ago  and increased investment in maintenance  and rehabilitation are pressing to ensure their continued operation  protect local populations from potential dam  failures  improve energy efficiency of hydropower generation  and provide a more reliable service to the  population 
55,21,Moreover  tightening fiscal space is constraining investment  The authorities are open to public  private investments in the sector  particularly downstream in the sector 
56,21,But an ambitious program to  strengthening the planning  funding and implementation functions is critical for that and enhance the delivery  capacity of the water system and infrastructure in the country 
58,22,7  The Valley of Mexico region has one of the highest water stress4 levels of the country 
59,22,This area of the  country generates an estimated 38 percent of Mexico s GDP  including the Valley of M xico Metropolitan Area   VMMA and Toluca Metropolitan Area  TMA  
60,22,Together  these two metropolitan areas account for a population

62,23,   4 Water stress is calculated by comparing the percentage of water allocated to the amount of renewable water 
63,23,Valley of Mexico has the  highest water stress index in Mexico  140   meaning that it uses 40  more water that what is renewed

66,26,of almost 23 4 million people and host a diverse range of economic activities  from manufacturing to agricultural  farmland  that require water for both consumption and economic development 
67,26,Nevertheless  deficient water  services  compounded by unreliable bulk water supply  impose economic costs on households and firms  equivalent to an estimated 1 percent of the GDP of the VMMA 5 With an estimated population of 21 5 million   the VMMA is considered the most populated urban center in Latin America  and currently demands a mean water  supply of 63 cubic meters per second  m3 s 6 for human consumption and industrial and commercial needs and  an estimated supply of 11 m3 s for irrigation purpose 
68,26,The TMA houses a population of approximately 1 9 million  people with a mean water demand of 4 7 m3 s 7 The bulk water supply and water service provision for these two  areas constitute a major challenge for the country 
69,26, The Cutzamala System plays an essential role in the supply  of water for the VMMA and TMA 
70,26,  Furthermore  many of the Cutzamala System s dams  which date from the  mid 1900s  require rehabilitation and safety improvements to address critical dam safety issues 
71,26, The Cutzamala  System is an energy intensive and energy inefficient system 
72,26, The VMMA and TMA depend on the Cutzamala  System as a main water provider  but also as a buffer for water shocks  including seismic events 
73,26,  Multiple federal  and local entities are involved in the management of the Cutzamala System 
74,26, Additionally  the VMMA relies on  the pumping of groundwater from aquifers for human consumption  industrial and commercial use  and irrigated  agriculture 
75,26, The ongoing overdraft of groundwater in the VMMA has resulted in significant land subsidence   damaging urban infrastructure and posing challenges to water supply

115,44,Predominant soils  andosols  are characterized by very low bulk  density and  being devoid of vegetation and located on slopes and hills  are highly vulnerable to water and  wind erosion 
116,44,Overall  the Cutzamala System faces important environmental challenges  including a process  of overall degradation of the ecosystems due to varied anthropogenic activities 
117,44,Consequently  it is  necessary to optimize the use of water and stop the processes of water and soil contamination  soil  degradation and deterioration of the adjacent natural habitats 
118,44,The latter include two federal Protected  Natural Areas  APN   The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve and Valle de Bravo  Malacatepec  Tilostoc  and Temascaltepec River Basins Protected Natural Resources Area 
119,44,Regarding social aspects  Mazahua  indigenous people are present in the Project area 
120,44,Component 2 will be developed in the lowest and most  horizontal plain of the Valley of Mexico  which is highly urbanized and corresponds to the surface occupied  by four large lakes and surrounding hillside plots 
121,44,The groundwater in this basin has been exploited for  decades for drinking water supply and water supply for agricultural and industrial activities  and the  extraction and demand are increasing 
122,44,Currently  68 percent of the water used in the Valley of Mexico is  pumped from groundwater leading to aquifer overexploitation and differential land subsidence and damage  to existing infrastructure 
123,44,This situation is aggravated by loss of permeable surface and reduction of  vegetation and recharge zones due to expansion of the urban area 
124,44,Project activities will mitigate impacts of  overexploitation of the aquifers and contribute to improve the reliability of the Cutzamala System  among  other benefits

129,47,The Project is classified as Environmental Category  B 
130,47,The expected negative environmental and social  impacts are relatively limited  and rather standard  mitigation measures are available to manage them  in line with the mitigation hiearchy 
131,47,The possible  negative environmental impacts of the Project are  associated with activities and works to be carried  out in areas with existing water abstraction  storage   dams   and conveyance infrastructure  and in two

134,50,pilot sites for recharging the aquifer with treated  wastewater 
135,50,The works involve the instrumentation   civil works and mechanical equipment for the  rehabilitation of the Cutzamala System Dams  as well  as upgrading of existing wastewater treatment  plants to improve wastewater effluent quality by  incorporating advanced treatment modules to  comply with Mexican water quality discharge  standards for aquifer recharge  aquifer recharge  wells  and conveyance infrastructure from the waste  water treatment plants  WWTPs  to the recharge  wells 
136,50,The identified environmental risks and  potential negative impacts include generation of  dust  gases and noise on the atmoshpere  derived  from the movement of materials and operation of  machinery and equipment and contamination of soil  and water due to improper handling of chemicals   construction waste and or hazardous waste   storage  transport and final disposal  
137,50,The identified  occupational health and safety  OHS  risks and  potential impacts include damage to health and  physical integrity of Project workers resulting from  improper handling of chemical products and waste   accidents due to inadequate traffic signals and  safety signs on work sites  and OHS issues due to  lack of personal protective equipment or training in  the use of tools and equipment 
138,50,   All these works and activities also have positive  environmental and social impacts and support the  efficient use of water resources in the area 
139,50, The Project includes works and activities for which  the corresponding detailed engineering designs will  be developed during Project implementation  and  their realization may involve construction  procedures and technologies that remain to be  defined 
140,50,Consequently  CONAGUA has prepared   consulted and disclosed an Environmental and Social  Management Framework  ESMF   which includes an  exclusion list  selection and evaluation procedure to  identify  evaluate and manage the possible impacts  and environmental and social risks under each  contract 
141,50,Both CONAGUA and the works  contractors  will apply the ESMF that covers the environmental  and social requirements for the contractors that will  be included in the bidding documents and

144,53,contracts The ESMF includes the selection of works  and the assignment of environmental and social  obligations in accordance with the applicable  national legislation e g 
145,53,on environment  health and  safety at work  It also proposes a set of good  environmental  safety and hygiene practices to be  applied in different types of activities 
146,53,Likewise  the  ESMF includes the establishment of efficient  mechanisms for the reception and attention of  potential complaints and other feedback from  stakeholders during the development of the works 
147,53,   The supervision of Project activities will include  evaluation of compliance with environmental  social   health and safety and cultural requirements 
148,53, CONAGUA and the Project contractors will be  responsible for the environmental  social and health  and safety  ESHS  management 
149,53,Strong  environmental clauses in terms of reference and  contracts will indicate the obligation of the  participating contractors to have the necessary  management capacity related to ESHS aspects 
150,53,   The ESMF was consulted on December 7 and 8  2017  and the results of these consultations were reflected  in the ESMF 
151,53,The ESMF was disclosed at the  CONAGUA and World Bank external websites on  January 15  2018  and the updated version in  December 2019  to reflect the reduced scope of the  Project investments with the final loan amount of  US  120 million instead of US  200 million 
153,54,No  OP 4 03 in not triggered as the Project includes no  private sector activity as defined by the policy  
154,55,In the area of influence of Component 1 in the  Cutzamala System there are two ANPs of federal  responsibility  the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere  Reserve and the Valle de Bravo  Malacatepec   Tilostoc and Temascaltepec River Basins Protected  Natural Resources Area  which present severe  problems of contamination and deterioration of  natural habitats derived from unplanned  anthropogenic activities that have been carried out  for years on the site 
155,55, The ongoing environmental degradation of  Cutzamala sub basins can lead to a loss of 
156,56,The World Bank   Water Security and Resilience for the Valley of Mexico  PROSEGHIR   P164389  
157,57,   Mar 16  2018 Page 10 of 19  
158,58,biodiversity in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere  Reserve  which protects key overwintering sites for a  billion monarch butterflies in 80 percent of the area  of the sub basins 
159,58,   Some of the Project s brownfield works and  activities will be carried out within the two referred  ANPs and their vicinity   
160,58,The ESMF stipulates that  these works and activities need to cover specific  measures to avoid and mitigate risks and negative  impacts in the ANPs  including additional monitoring  actions as pertinent  and to comply with their  existing management plans 
161,58,    In relation to the Valley of Mexico  one of the two  possible pilot sites for groundwater recharge wells is  located in the  Cerro de la Estrella  National Park   yet it no longer meets the criteria established for an  ANP and is subject to revocation of its status as such 
162,58, In every case  any works in the area will need to  secure minimum risk and negative impact in its  remanent natural value  
163,59,Forests OP BP 4 36 No  OP 4 36 is not triggered as the Project does not  foresee activities that will affect forests and or  forest depended communities  
164,60,Pest Management OP 4 09 No  OP 4 09 in not triggered as no Project activity will  include pest management or procurement of  pesticides or other agrochemicals  
165,61,OP 4 11 is triggered for precautionary purposes 
166,61,The  Project will not impact any known physical cultural  resource  and based on a preliminary assessment  it  is unlikely that physical cultural resources would be  found in the areas directly affected by the Project  works 
167,61,However  the ESMF includes guidance and  procedures for any potential chance finds  
168,62,The social assessment during preparation indicates  the presence of indigenous peoples  Mazahuas  in  the areas of influence of the project 
169,62,These  communities will not be directly negatively impacted  by the Project  but rather benefit from the project s  results 
170,62, The client developed a Indigenous Peoples  Planning Framework  IPPF  to ensure the inclusion of  the IP groups in a culturally appropriate manner

177,65,Participants included local  leaders  Mazahua  Indigenous peoples group  present in the intervention area   civil society  leaders  academics  researchers  users  neighbors   state and federal government officials 
178,65, While the Project is not expected to have a negative  impacts  the Mazahua requested that the  government   i  strengthen citizen participation  mechanisms and mainstream communication and  outreach efforts to indigenous communities   ii   allocate the equivalent of 5 percent of the total cost  of works and infrastructure for the implementation  of infrastructure and community services  and  iii   ensure the continuation of the integrated basin  management 
179,65, The IPPF was consulted in two workshops with  relevant stakeholders on December 7 and 8  2017 
180,65,  Feedback and a summary of the consultation  process and issues raised by the Indigenous Peoples  leaders were integrated in the IPPF 
181,65,It was disclosed  on CONAGUA s and the WB s website on January 15   2018  and the updated version in December 2019 to  reflect the reduced scope of the Project investments  with the final loan amount of US  120 million  instead of US  200 million 
183,66,The Project is not expected to result in involuntary  land acquisition  resettlement  and or displacement  of people irrespective of whether they are  indigenous or non indigenous 
184,66,The Project will only  be implemented on federal lands within a 50 meter  wide strip of CONAGUA property  and pilot projects  under component 2 2 will focus on the improvement  and maintenance of existing infrastructures 
185,66, However  OP 4 12 on Involuntary Resettlement is  triggered as a precautionary measure  in the unlikely  case that land acquisition or resettlement will be  needed 
186,66,A Resettlement Policy Framework  RPF  was
