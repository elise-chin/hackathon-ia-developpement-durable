75,71,1  El Salvador  the smallest country in Central America and one of the most densely populated in the world  has  registered persistent low levels of growth in the past decades 
76,71,With a population of 6 4 million  in addition to 1 5 million  Salvadorian living outside the country  and a total land area of 21 041 square kilometers  the country is one of the world s  most densely populated 1 The Gross Domestic Product  GDP  annual growth has reached 3 percent only twice since 2000   with an average of 2 3 percent in recent years 
77,71,In 2019 the GDP grew 2 3 percent  fueled by remittances  robust domestic  consumption  and investment2 
78,71,In 2020  it contracted by 7 9 percent due to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019  COVID 2019   and has begun recovering in 2021  projected growth of 8 percent 3 
79,71,However  public debt remains high  up to 91 8 percent  of GDP in 2020  and constitutes the main vulnerability of economic performance  whereas fiscal deficits have constrained  the overall competitiveness 
80,71,Persistent high levels of illegal activities and gang related violence deter private investments  and slow public investments 
81,71,Facing limited employment opportunities and high exposure to crime and violence  many  Salvadorians have migrated from the country 
82,71,By early 2020  remittances from abroad accounted for nearly one fifth of  the country s GDP4 
83,71,Poverty has declined since 2007 but remains high  in 2019  23 percent of the population lived below  the poverty line  and 1 5 percent in extreme poverty conditions 5 6 
84,72,2  El Salvador s high vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change negatively affects is economy 
85,72,The  country is among the most affected by weather related events and other hazards  incurring annual losses of around 2 5  percent of GDP 7  It also ranks second highest for risk exposure to two or more hazards  and highest for the total population  at a relatively high risk of mortality 
86,72,It is estimated that over 90 percent of the population live in areas considered at risk  of natural hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and climate related impacts such as floods  droughts  and  storms 8 Projections for the 2040 2059 period indicate there will be an increase in annual maximum 5 days rainfall by  18 75 mm  as well as in mean annual temperature by 1 64 C 
87,72,The annual precipitation  on the other hand  will decrease  by  65 33mm  in the same period  The most frequent natural disasters are droughts  floods  storms  earthquakes  and  volcanic activity 
88,72,The occurrence of extreme rainfall events threatens the food and water security and livelihoods of people  living on degraded hilly lands 
89,72,Also  rising temperatures are predicted to reduce the country s yields of main crops by 30  percent by 2050  mainly through recurrent drought 9 
90,73,3  Furthermore  the consequences of COVID 19 have significantly affected the economy and people s livelihoods   By December 2021  El Salvador confirmed 121 200 cases of COVID 19 and 3797 deaths10 
91,73,Due to the pandemic  the poverty  rate increased by 4 6 percentage points from 2019 and 202011 
92,73,The Government responded with early quarantines   movement restrictions  and severe penalties for not respecting the confinement measures  An economic reopening plan

108,77,was issued on June 1  2020  expecting to reactivate sectorial activity progressively 
109,77,The World Bank  WB   among other  international organizations  provided support to El Salvador through an Emergency Response Project under the COVID 19  Strategic Preparedness and Response Program  SPRP   with a loan of US 20 million12 
110,77,Due to the pandemic s economic  impacts  thousands of jobs have been lost  potentially promoting a rural migration in some areas as unemployed adults  move to the country in search of sustenance opportunities 13 
111,78,4  El Salvador s rich and diverse natural capital is crucial to sustaining key sectors of the economy and support the  livelihoods of the rural poor 
112,78,Natural capital represents 10 percent of total per capita wealth  including from crop lands   pasture lands  and forests 
113,78,These assets underpin important sectors of the economy  such as agriculture  forestry  and  fishing  which together contributed to 16 percent of the GDP  in 2018 
114,78,Agriculture alone contributed around 12 percent  to the GDP  supporting the livelihoods of the rural poor through food security and employment 14  15 16 The forest sector   on the other hand  contributed 1 5 percent of the GDP  mainly from wood products  57 percent  and generated about 0 5  percent of the labor force  representing two percent of agriculture 
115,78,The forest sector also produces goods and income for  many small subsistence farmers from Non Timber Forestry Products  NTFPs   and it is source of fuelwood for  approximately 23 percent of the rural population and 3 5 percent of the urban one 17 Although not accounted in the GDP   the ecosystem services provided by forests are also critical for the viability of productive sectors and the rural livelihoods  as they contribute to ensure water supply  reduce soil erosion  landslides  sedimentation  and risk of floods  enhance  resilience to climate change  and conserve the habitats  of some 33 871 species 
116,78,Mangroves  for example  play a crucial  role for coastal communities as are essential nursery habitat for fisheries and protect shorelines from storms and  hurricane winds  waves  and floods 18 19  
117,79,5  Despite its importance  the country s natural capital is rapidly degrading due to unsustainable land use  which  leads to high fragmentation of critical forest ecosystems 
118,79,Currently  the country s rural landscape is composed of intricate  mosaics that include forest patches  coffee farms  pasture  bushes  subsistence crops  and sugarcane  among others  while  the remaining area of natural ecosystems is limited 
119,79,Approximately 60 percent of the territory is used for agricultural  production  and farms cover 80 percent of the land area in a diverse agriculture forest landscape20 
120,79,Although forests cover  approximately 38 8 percent of the country s territory  they are young and fragmented secondary forests  58 percent  and  shaded coffee  21 percent  
121,79,Forests have been lost at an estimated average annual rate of 2 6 percent  equivalent to about  21 700 ha year  which places the country as the second most deforested in Latin America  in the last five decades  the  country lost 60 percent of its mangroves  passing from almost 100 000 ha to only 40 000 ha 21   
122,80,6 
123,80,Deforestation and forest degradation undermine ecosystem services  disturb local water systems  and cause  severe land degradation  threatening agricultural productivity and exacerbating the country s vulnerability to climate  change and food insecurity

134,83,the low opportunity cost of forests  has become a major concern since critical environmental thresholds have been  reached  where the vulnerability of agricultural practices and food security are at historical limits 22  Approximately 15  percent of the country s territory is experiencing severe land degradation  a major source of vulnerability  climate risk   and food and water insecurity 
135,83,Half of the land area is considered unsuitable for food cultivation due to overuse of  agrochemicals  leading to water and soil contamination as well as soil erosion  over 42 percent of landslide prone areas  and 64 percent of main water recharge areas lack tree cover  and more than half of the riparian forests associated to the  main rivers have been lost 23 Deforestation and land degradation also leads to habitat loss  the main threat to biodiversity  conservation 
137,84,7 
138,84,Improving the management of natural resources at the landscape level is important to enhance the country s  resilience to weather related events and for providing economic opportunities for rural economies 
139,84,Healthy agriculture  and forest landscapes can offset some of the impacts of climate related disasters by enhancing the forest ecosystem s  resilience to changing weather patterns  providing important safety nets for local communities to cope with climate  shocks  enhancing the productivity of farming systems  and reducing damage from flooding and sea level rise  among  others 
140,84,In addition  forest landscapes provide key ecosystem services such as biodiversity habitat  water filtration and  availability  increased food security  soil erosion control  and reduction of Greenhouse Gases  GHG  emissions 
141,84,The  unsustainable management of these natural assets negatively affect rural jobs and revenue generation  impacting  economic growth and disproportionally affecting the rural poor and vulnerable communities 
142,84,The COVID 19 pandemic  precipitates deforestation and forest degradation associated to an increased internal demand for food  raw material  and  commodities  often satisfied through unsustainable farming systems   by August 2020  global deforestation rates had  increased 77 percent during the pandemic 
144,85,8  Sustainable natural resources management and land restoration is the joint responsibility of two ministries 
145,85, The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources  Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales  MARN  is responsible  for implementing the National Environmental Policy  which provides the framework for sustainable use of natural  resource protection  conservation  and restoration of the environment 
146,85,The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock   Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganader a  MAG  administers the regulations for agriculture  irrigation  forestry  fisheries  and  aquaculture 
147,85,MAG implements national regulations and planning through the General Directorate of Forestry   Watersheds  and Irrigation  Direcci n General Ordenamiento Forestal  Cuencas  y Riego  DGFCR  and provides extension  and technology transfer through the National Agricultural and Forestry Technology Center  Centro Nacional de Tecnolog a  Agropecuaria y Forestal  CENTA  
148,85,Locally  municipalities and local governments implement projects in their territories  according to Local Sustainable Development Plans  Planes Locales de Desarrollo Sostenible  PDLS  
149,85,MARN and MAG  coordinate with Non Governmental Organizations  NGOs   international development agencies  and local stakeholders  for the implementation of land restoration policies seeking to promote rural development and ecosystems  adaptation to  the impacts of climate change 
151,86,9  In its efforts to address forest loss and environmental degradation  El Salvador has established an enabling a  national regulatory framework to implement integrated forest landscape restoration 
152,86,Various policies  plans  and  programs established in El Salvador during the past two decades have identified the consolidation of forest management   conservation  and restoration as a key priority for reducing the country s vulnerability to climate change and extreme  climate events

181,96,Under this context  El Salvador aims to implement the ecosystems and landscape restoration approach at the  Conservations Areas scale  the administrative regions for natural resource management created under the PNODT 
182,96,The  El Imposible y Barra de Santiago Conservation Area  EIBSCA  has been prioritized in the National Plan Against  Deforestation  Soil Erosion  and Desertification due to prominent levels of poverty  particularly in six municipalities of the  Ahuachap n department within the Corredor Seco  and considerable environmental pressures from agriculture 
183,96,EIBSCA  provides essential environmental services  including from El Imposible National Park  the Barra de Santiago Ramsar site   and Los C banos Important Bird Area  it is habitat for twenty three vulnerable species  ten endangered  and five critically  endangered under IUCN s Red List of Endangered Species 
184,96,EIBSCA is highly vulnerable to land degradation as it contains  steep  more than 35 percent  slopes and is especially prone to droughts  it contains an entire water basin  which connects  the practices of subsistence basic grain producers with sugarcane producers 
185,96, However  unplanned expansion of sugar  cane and basic grain crops coupled with unsustainable production practices are degrading land and biodiversity in  ecosystems across EIBSCA  including mangroves and riparian forests  and soil within farms  reducing their productivity and  environmental sustainability 
186,96,Sugar cane plantations increased from 60 000 to 80 000 ha in the 2006 2015 period leading  to loss of mangrove forests  and the displacement of traditional crops to higher mountain areas  which are consequently  degraded and affect the provision of hydrological services for the overall country s economy  and particularly for  sugarcane crops themselves 
187,96,The use of unsustainable practices and continued deforestation to produce basic grains for  subsistence has aggravated erosion in the high areas of the region 
188,96,The pressure of recent droughts and extreme weather  events that lead to landslides combined with these factors exacerbate land degradation   
189,97,12  Several initiatives are contributing to revert land degradation in the EIBSCA region 
190,97,These include local  governance platforms such as groups of water boards and agricultural associations  the Ramsar committee  and Local  Advisor Committees  Comit s Asesores Locales  COAL   among others 
191,97,Also  ongoing projects in the region or in  neighboring areas are implementing some dimensions of landscape restoration in specific areas and providing valuable  lessons 
192,97,For example  the project Upscaling Climate Resilience Measures in the Dry Corridor Agroecosystems of El Salvador   known as RECLIMA   co financed by the Green Climate Fund  GCF 40  which has a national scope but targets some highly  vulnerable municipalities of EIBSCA 
193,97,Other programs and projects include the Resilient Central America  ResCA41   Program  the Ecosystems Restoration in Degraded Areas in EIBSCA project42  the Strengthening the Climatic Resilience of  Rural Communities and Ecosystems in Ahuachap n Sur43  the Enabling Concerted Management from the Source to the  Ocean in the Rio Paz Watershed GEF project  and the GEF Project Climate Change Adaptation to Reduce Land Degradation  in Fragile Micro Watersheds Located in the Municipalities of Texistepeque and Candelaria de la Frontera  among others 
194,97, Projects currently undergoing preparation seek to address new areas such as developing an incentive program to promote

201,101,13  The sugar cane industry is also progressively incorporating environmental criteria to enhance its sustainability  and resilience to the impact of climate change 
202,101,In 2017  the Sugar Foundation  Fundaci n del Az car  FUNDAZUCAR  and  the Salvadoran Association of the Sugar Industry developed the sugar cane sustainability strategy and a manual of good  practices that incorporate environmental criteria applicable throughout the value chain 
203,101,44 45 These developments were  mostly driven by the need to respond to national regulation  i  against the contamination and the harmful effects on the  ecosystems caused by burning practices and use of agrochemicals   ii  to manage water use  and to  iii  address the impact  of sugar cane on deforestation considering that sugar cane was responsible for around 50 000 ha of deforestation in the  2000 2010 period 46 To support regulation enforcement MARN  MAG  the Salvadoran Association of the Sugar Industry   and the Salvadorian Council of the Sugar Industry  Consejo Salvadore o de la Agroindustria Azucarera  CONSAA  joined  efforts to promote the adoption of green harvesting practices by developing specific technical guidelines aligned with the  broader technical guidelines for land restoration in El Salvador 47 More recently  motivated by international trends  one  of the six sugar mills encompassing the Salvadoran Association of the Sugar Industry achieved the BONSUCRO certification  in 6 660 ha  See Box 1   which represents 8 25 percent of the country s total sugar cane area 
205,102,BONSUCRO is a global multi stakeholder non profit organization that promotes sustainable sugarcane  production  processing  and trade around the world  BONSUCRO provides a definition for sustainable 
206,103,sugarcane and all sugarcane derived products through a multi stakeholder approach 
207,103,The BONSUCRO  Production Standard48 defines a set of principles  criteria  and indicators against the three pillars of  sustainability 
208,103,As an example  below is a subset of principles  criteria  and indicators relevant to this Project  
209,104,Criterion 4 1  To assess impact of sugarcane enterprises on biodiversity and ecosystem services  
210,105,Indicator 4 1 2 Percentage of areas defined internationally or nationally as legally protected or  classified as a High Conservation Value planted to sugarcane after the cut off date of Jan  1  2008 
212,106,Indicator 4 1 3  The key environmental issues are covered by an appropriate and implemented  environmental impact and management plan  
213,107,14  Despite these efforts  there is still much to be done to implement integrated landscape management and  restoration in EIBSCA 
214,107,Past and existing projects have produced positive impacts in certain areas of EIBSCA  but they are  unaligned with the aim of ecosystem services provision at the conservation area level 
215,107,Projects are often scattered in  specific protected areas  communities  watersheds  or coastal zones  aiming at achieving land restoration for different  purposes such as biodiversity protection  water sources conservation  soil retention  or climate change adaptation and  resilience 
216,107,However  landscape management and restoration in EIBSCA entails addressing in an integral manner the  following barriers   i  high vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather   ii  limited incentives for sustainable  agriculture practices   iii  a lack of human and financial resources to promote sustainable production   iv  perverse

223,110,The proposed project seeks to contribute to remove some of these barriers by  strategically investing financial resources in establishing land restoration technologies and in promoting adequate  management and monitoring approaches 
224,110,The proposed project seeks to involve public and private stakeholders in  strategic planning  create knowledge and awareness on the value of ecosystem services  strengthening stakeholder s  capacity  and providing resources to remove financial barriers to implement Sustainable Landscape Management  SLM   measures in critical areas to ensure the flow of essential ecosystem services across EIBSCA 
226,111,15  The proposed Project contributes directly to the GEF objectives in the focal areas of Biodiversity and Land  Degradation 
227,111,The Project advances the GEF 7 Biodiversity Focal Area  BD1 1  by mainstreaming biodiversity across sectors  and supporting informed decision making that considers biodiversity and ecosystem values 
228,111,It will particularly contribute  to achieving the following country s Aichi targets49  Target  2 incorporating biodiversity considerations into land use  planning  Target   5 reducing the loss of natura habitats  Target  7 sustainable management of agriculture and forest  areas  Target  14 rehabilitation of ecosystem services  and Target   15 restoration of at least 15 percent of degraded  lands 
229,111,The Project will also contribute to the main objectives of the Land Degradation Focal Area  LD 1 1   3  LD 2 5  by  creating an enabling environment for PANSAL implementation and the country s development of the voluntary LDN  targets 
231,112,16 
232,112,The proposed Project aligns with the World Bank Group s corporate goals  Climate Change Action Plan  Forest  Action Plan  and Country Partnership Framework  CPF  FY15 19 for El Salvador  Report   95383  discussed by the  Executive Directors on June 23  2015 
233,112,Specifically  the Project directly addresses issues related to the Bank s overarching  Twin Goals  eradicating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity  
234,112,This is achieved by promoting sustainable  agricultural productivity that supports jobs and food security and enhancing the sustainability of small scale farm  producers in one of the most vulnerable regions of El Salvador 
235,112,The Project is also consistent with the El Salvador CPF s  Objective  b  Build Capacity to Manage Disasters and Environmental Degradation  under Strategic Pilar II Fostering  Sustainability 
236,112,Similarly  the Project contributes to compliance with the Climate Change Action Plan 2016 202050   particularly on Priority III Scale Up Climate Action by promoting climate smart land use including elements of SLM  land  restoration  ecosystem based adaptation  and coastal area management  as well as Climate Change Action Plan 2021  202551 under the Agriculture  Food  Water  and Land heading  which emphasizes Nature Based Solutions 
237,112,Also  the  proposed project advances the Forest Action Plan FY16 FY2052  particularly on Focus Area 2  Forest Smart Interventions  in Other Economic Sectors  and by addressing cross cutting themes such as climate change and resilience  participation  and rights  and institutions and governance 
238,112,The Project builds on the FCPF REDD  Readiness Preparation Project   P124935  and the 2020 Country Forest Note  A Green Deal for El Salvador  Forest based Green Infrastructure for Income  and Services53

249,116,As El Salvador is among the countries participating in the UNCCD Program on LDN Targets Setting  this  project is aligned with this engagement 
250,116,Finally  the Project is well positioned to contribute to advancing the country s  NDC which identifies agriculture and water among the priority areas for climate action to promote climate change  adaptation  while setting GHG mitigation targets across sectors through improved forest cover 
251,116,The nature based  solutions promoted by the proposed Project would also contribute to enhance ecosystems resilience to the impacts of  climate change by enhancing local governance for land restoration  forest ecosystems services protection  and  implementation of SLM practices 
253,117,18  The proposed PDO is to promote integrated landscape management and restoration in targeted areas of El  Salvador   
254,118,19  The Project s primary beneficiaries are EIBSCA region rural dwellers  especially those within the selected critical  areas and basins 
255,118,This includes small subsistence farms   3 ha   family farms  and communities that mainly produce basic  grains in slopes and near relevant ecosystems 
256,118,At least 1040 producers will receive support for restoration practices and  conserving key ecosystems 
257,118,These will be selected from the municipalities in the Ahuachap n Department  including San  Pedro Puxtla  Guaymango  Jujutla  San Francisco Men ndez y Ataco  prioritizing vulnerable populations such as women   young and indigenous communities 
258,118,Approximately 250 sugar cane producers  medium and smallholders located in the  municipalities of Acajutla  San Francisco Men ndez  and Jujutla will benefit from technical assistance for restoration  activities and SLM implementation 
259,118,Additionally  local governance bodies will be strengthened  especially water boards   COAL  and Ramsar committees  providing them with technical capacity and promoting collaborative arrangements 
260,118,Hence   approximately 575 more people will benefit directly from the support to the local planning processes  PLAS  under  Component 1 
261,118,The total number of direct beneficiaries is therefore expected to reach 1 865   
262,119,20  Indirect beneficiaries include the population in the entire landscape  especially those in the selected basins 
263,119,The  198 556 inhabitants of the region  especially the rural population  will benefit from improved ecosystem services  mainly  hydrological   reduced erosion  disaster risks  and water contamination 
264,119,This includes Indigenous Peoples  IPs   vulnerable  small farmers  and the communities associated with the basins  ecosystem services at the landscape scale

400,172,37  MARN will be responsible for the overall M E of the Project  It will be carried out following the GEF tracking  tools under Component 3 
401,172,An M E consultant will prepare the detailed guidelines and documentation based on the POM  for the process and the required documentation 
402,172,The consultant will implement M E activities during the first year of the  Project  Then  they will be implemented by the Project coordinator until the end of the Project 
403,172,Data for M E project  outcomes will be derived from various sources that feed national processes such as the PANSAL 
404,172,The results will be  followed up in midterm and final reviews to assess the project activities  outcomes   
405,173,38 
406,173,The Project will contribute to reducing pressures on local biodiversity  including endangered species  advance  compliance with LDN and climate change mitigation through the restoration and improved management of a  Conservation Area  EIBSCA  identified by MARN as a critical area for biodiversity conservation 
407,173,The outcomes of the  practices promoted by the Project as well as the restoration of critical land will contribute to reducing pressures  increasing  connectivity for globally important biodiversity and ecosystems 
408,173,Importantly  the EIBSCA is one of the sites with the  highest species richness and the occurrence of restricted species in the country 
409,173,It includes protected areas and globally  relevant areas  while hosting important biodiversity  see Section I B     
410,174,39  The Project is aligned with four GEF focal areas  BD 1 1  LD 1 1  LD 1 3  and LD 2 5 
411,174,The Project would help  integrate biodiversity and improve the flow of services in agroecosystems in EIBSCA  by promoting improved management  and restoration of degraded land  by piloting improved practices involving cocoa  agro silvo pastoral systems  as well as  agroforestry systems and basic grains 
412,174,The Project will also help maintain and enhance the flow of ecosystem services  through the restoration of gallery forests and mangroves  as well as by strengthening governance at the landscape level  and promoting private compensation for ecosystem services agreements 
413,174,Finally  the Project would help reduce the  pressure on fragile forest ecosystems from sugar cane by supporting the adoption of improved agriculture practices  which  will help enhance the resilience of the wider landscape 
414,174,The Project will apply the ISR  which contains indicators to monitor  progress on biodiversity  governance  water quality  vulnerability reduction  climate change mitigation  and livelihoods  enhancement 
416,175,40  GHG analysis  An estimate of the Project s GHG mitigation potential was prepared using the Ex Ante carbon  balance tool  EX ACT  from the Food and Agriculture Organization  FAO  
417,175,See Annex 5 for details 
418,175,The preliminary analysis  compares the current land uses and productive practices prior to the project implementation   business as usual   and  the improved system  considering the restored land and better production practices promoted by the Project 
419,175,The analysis  was performed over 20 years  estimating that the Project is a carbon sink of 444 851 tons of Carbon Dioxide equivalent   tCO2 eq  
420,175,Subcomponent 2 1 on implementation of restoration activities contributes the greatest to reducing emissions  
421,176,41  Areas of land restored 
422,176,The proposed project seeks to restore the functions of critical ecosystems in EIBSCA  through assisting the recovery of land in 1 040 ha carefully selected using multiple environmental criteria 
423,176,The Project will  restore agriculture land that have been degraded to the extent that it cannot fulfill its ecological functions and delivery of  environmental services 
424,176,The Project will make investments to promote restoration practices rigorously designed through  applying the ROAM methodology  which integrate results from a participatory process and from technical and cost benefit  analysis 
425,176,The selected practices will be established in critical sites to ensure they contribute to enhanced water  conservation  groundwater recharge  and improved vegetative cover 
426,176,The practices include basic grains  cocoa  agro silvo  pastoral systems  and agroforestry systems 
427,176,The Project would also help apply best practices of ecological restoration in  100 ha of gallery forests and in 40 ha of mangroves 
428,176,The impacts of these interventions on water quality and biodiversity 
429,177,  The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration  P170854  
430,178,enhancement across the landscape and specific ecosystems will be captured through the ISR and the project results  framework   
431,179,42  Areas of landscapes under Improved practices  excluding protected areas   The proposed project seeks to  promote the adoption of new and or improved SLM practices in 52 014 ha of land 
432,179,Adoption refers to change of practice  or change in the use of a technology promoted or introduced by the Project 
433,179,SLM practices refers to a combination of  technologies and approaches to increase land quality and restore degraded lands 
434,179,Out of the total areas  the Project would  promote land management approaches that benefit biodiversity in 51 294 ha 
435,179,The Project would also intervene on  landscape area currently under unsustainable sugar cane production  by promoting adoption of the BONSUCRO standard   which seek to prevent the cultivation of sugarcane on areas of critical conservation value or areas legally protected 
436,179,The  BONSUCRO standard also seek ensure sugarcane plantations address environmental issues such as biodiversity   ecosystem services  soil  water  climate change  among others following an appropriate environmental impact and  management plan 
437,179,The BONSUCRO standard also certifies adequate implementation and progress monitored of the  Environmental impact and management plan      
438,180,43  GEF Incremental Analysis  Assuming the GEF project was not implemented   Business as usual    current practices  would continue to increase land  water  and biodiversity degradation 
439,180,Other small scale interventions in the landscape  are scattered without the Project and lack a strategic framework for coordinating efforts 
440,180,Moreover  without the Project   the GoES does not have the resources to promote  coordinate the objectives  or adequately monitor and evaluate  integrated land management and restoration activities 
441,180,Consequently  the natural resources will continue to be used  without consideration for sustaining the provision of ecosystem services critical for the local communities and biodiversity 
442,180, Deforestation of 1 3 percent annually is expected to continue or be exacerbated by the effects of the current economic  crisis  and soil degradation will further expose the landscape to climate change related hazards such as landslides 
443,180, Similarly  habitats and downstream water quality would be lost  making future restoration efforts more challenging and  complex 
444,180,The sustainability of agricultural production in the landscape would be at risk in the mid term due to increased  vulnerability and reduced productivity   
445,181,44 
446,181,Investments with GEF support will enable the GoES to address the management of the EIBSCA by promoting  sustainable practices at a landscape scale  improving coordination through existing and new institutions  and financing  demonstration plots with improved management practices and restoration activities in critical farms 
447,181,A considerable  gap between downstream sugarcane producers and the ecosystem services originating from upstream small scale farms   cannot be effectively addressed in the baseline scenario 
448,181,Through the PAR  the local governments have prioritized  sugarcane and basic grain farms connected by waterways across the EIBSCA region 
449,181,However  they fail to connect medium  or large scale sugarcane farmers in the lowlands with small scale farmers in the high areas to achieve integrated landscape  management 
450,181,The Project will target resources based on existing IUCN and WRI analyses and thorough consultation  processes to guide land and beneficiaries  prioritization 
451,181,GEF funding will primarily finance improved practices and  restoration activities in collaboration with current projects from FIAES and other organizations and prepare farmers to  understand the benefits and promote these practices beyond the Project 
452,181,The proposed approach will improve  collaborative governance structures  support farmers with initial investments  train them to implement and maintain  improved practices  and then promote these practices while building up the capacities of extension services to implement  further actions towards integrated landscape management of the EIBSCA 
454,182,45  The Project investments will generate synergies with projects supported by GCF  FAO  and UNDP in the region  and more broadly across El Salvador 
455,182,Through the Ahuachap n s Roundtable  coordinated by MARN  a series of parallel  interventions have been identified as relevant for generating synergies 
456,182,The Project will be implemented in collaboration  and constant dialogue with these through the mentioned Roundtable  aggregating positive impacts in the landscape and  accelerating the transition to an integrated landscape management that is beneficial for biodiversity and climate action 
457,182, Specifically  RECLIMA  to be implemented across El Salvador including the EIBSCA  will contribute to climate resilience and

460,184,The Project will also  build on other projects led by MARN  with support from GIZ  to integrate valuable lessons on monitoring of restoration  activities    D  Sustainability 
461,185,46  A combination of investment support to leverage high upfront costs  capacity building  and demonstrative  projects will help secure the long term adoption of new sustainable practices 
462,185,These efforts will be aligned with parallel  financing from a series of projects currently under development and to be implemented in the future from the GCF  FAO   UNDP  German Cooperation Agency  Deutsche Gesellschaft f r Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH  GIZ  and others   which will be aligned through the MARN and Ahuachap n s Coordination Roundtable  further augmenting the impacts of  the Project and helping secure their sustainability 
463,185,A series of reciprocal CES agreements will complement these  developments to finance restoration from private and target natural water management and secure ecosystem services 
464,185, The arrangements will provide long term financial resources from sugarcane producers for ongoing operations and  maintenance of restoration and conservation activities to upstream farmers 
465,185,They are expected to prompt other similar  agreements in the area  They will also increase recognition and highlight ecosystems  role in water management and the  importance of their protection   
466,186,47  The Project seeks to strengthening the technical capacity of public institutions  local NGOs  and participatory  governance platforms  securing support for restoration and sustainable practices 
467,186,Component 1 will finance PLAS and a  new restoration roundtable  i e   MRdR   which will guide long term restoration and sustainable and local natural resource  management 
468,186,Simultaneously  an environmental education plan will be developed to disseminate the benefits of  ecosystem services in support of various project activities 
469,186,This plan will first produce knowledge about previous similar  interventions  success and then increase the population s knowledge base  thus increasing support for current and future  restoration projects 
470,186,Under Component 2  sustainable farming practices will be institutionalized through extension  support schemes  facilitating long term financial resources 
471,186,Implementing the BONSUCRO standard for sugarcane  producers in the selected locations will secure sustainable practices in the long term and promote the transition to SLM  in other areas 
472,186,These practices will be supported in farms that have already integrated some elements of the BONSUCRO  standard in their management plans for several years  demonstrating their interest in adopting the standard s practices 
474,187,48  Knowledge management  The PIU will be responsible for knowledge management and dissemination 
475,187,The  information produced through the implementation of  and improvements to the ISR will be made available through  MARN s and MAG s public platforms  reporting key indicators associated with the sustainability of the landscape and  restoration activities 
476,187,These elements will also be included in PAR and EN REP reports 
477,187,Through the environmental  education plan  the Project will disseminate the knowledge generated in the Project and other previous projects in the  area  contributing to improving the information baseline for planners  technicians  and stakeholders involved in managing  the landscape 
478,187,The M E system will also generate other knowledge products and services that will be disseminated among  project beneficiaries through a range of communication channels  using user friendly communication tools 
479,187,During project  implementation  MARN will ensure continued learning exchanges among existing projects through the Ahuachap n  roundtable  which brings together all the landscape initiatives in the region 
480,187,Besides the project knowledge management  strategy and the communications plan  MARN will disseminate project information in the World Overview of Conservation  Approaches and Technologies  WOCAT 58

482,189,49  Innovation and replication potential 
483,189,The proposed project seeks to foster a transformation of the EIBSCA  landscape by bringing together individuals  communities  businesses  NGOs  and government institutions to participate in  a governance platform at the level of the Conservation Area 
484,189,The Project addresses interinstitutional coordination barriers  for landscape transformation at such a scale 
485,189,It seeks to enhance participatory territorial planning involving public and  private stakeholders and promotes private sector engagement on environmental services agreements  SLM  implementation  and certification  i e   through BONSUCRO  
486,189,The Project is innovative in applying the ISR for progress  monitoring at scale  it also represents a test to implement in an integrated manner the GoES international commitments  acquired under UNFCCC  UNCCD  and CBD  following the 2021 National Plan to Combat Deforestation  Erosion  and  Desertification 
487,189,The Project is the first of its kind in El Salvador to implement landscape management and restoration at  the conservation area level  in line with the ambition established in the PREP 
488,189,The lessons learned from implementing this  project would be used to progressively replicate the experience in the remaining 15 conservation areas  
489,190,50 
490,190,The technical analysis has been based on the guidelines prepared for PANSAL and EN REP  the baseline from the  ROAM analysis by IUCN  and the sector diagnosis set in the Bank s 2020 Country Forest Note59 
491,190,The project design has also  drawn from the project experience of FIAES and FUNDEMAS and the ground experience from FUNDAZUCAR regarding  BONSUCRO standard 
492,190,The technical formulation also received the Bank team s support during a series of in country and  virtual preparation support missions in 2020 and 2021  
493,191,51  The economic analysis presents the economic benefits generated by the Project  see Annex 6  
494,191,Three benefit  streams have been measured   i  ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits provided by Integrated Landscape  Management   ii  carbon storage and sequestration by sustainable practices and restoration  and  iii  mangrove  restoration and activities at the producer level  enabling them to transit to sustainable management activities that have  positive social and private returns 
496,192,52 
497,192,For the economic and financial analysis  the  business as usual  baseline case assumes that future development  trends follow those of the past and no changes in policies and practices will take place 
498,192,A 20 year period has been  assumed to assess the economic feasibility of the Project 
499,192,While the project costs are only assumed to emerge for the five  years of project implementation  the benefits  from the increased area under improved landscape management and  sustainable practices  and opportunity costs are assumed to be generated beyond the five year implementation period 
501,193,53 
502,193,The incremental economic analysis shows that the net present value  NPV  is projected to reach US 5 2 million   lower bound   and US 6 million  upper bound  in the baseline scenario  20 years  carbon social price of US 60  and 6  percent discount rate  
503,193,The investments evaluated for the economic and financial assessment will generate a Benefit  Cost ratio between 2 36 and 2 52  and an internal rate of return  IRR  between 23 and 25 percent 
504,193,Thus  the economic  and financial analysis shows that  if project implementation is effective and efficient  project supported investments will  bring substantial financial and economic benefits to agriculture and livestock producers in the project area and to  Salvadoran society in general 
505,193,The results of the quantitative simulations are robust in terms of sensitivity analyses 
506,193, Increasing the discount rate from six to nine percent  reducing the carbon social price by 33 percent  from US 60 to

510,197,54  Shown estimates correspond to a lower bound as they represent the benefit streams derived from the Project  applying a very conservative approach 
511,197,The Project s economic value is likely to be higher since the analysis did not include  other non economic global and local benefits such as resulting improvements in food security   
512,198,55  The PIU will handle FM tasks with the support from UFI 
513,198,Based on a simplified assessment of the FM  arrangements  the Bank concluded that the controls and systems that MARN has in place are adequate to administer  financial aspects of the proposed Project 
514,198,MARN has relevant experience implementing WB financed projects with  satisfactory FM performance and the FM staff are qualified 
515,198,In addition  the PIU will be staffed with a well seasoned  financial specialist hired under Terms of Reference  ToR  agreed with the WB 
516,198,Like in a recent operation  FCPF REDD   Readiness Preparation Project P124935   MARN will use the Financial Administration System  Sistema de Administraci n  Financiera Integrado  SAFI  to record financial transactions  and will maintain a set of subsidiary ledgers in excel  spreadsheets to prepare financial statements required by the Bank 
517,198,The PIU will produce semi annual interim unaudited  financial reports containing at least   i  a statement of sources and uses of funds  with expenditures classified by  component and subcomponent  and cash balances   ii  a statement of budget execution per component and  subcomponent   iii  a reconciliation of the designated account  DA   and  iv  a simplified subproject statement 
518,198,Annual  financial statements will be audited by a private firm under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank  The audit work  will be financed with grant proceeds 
519,198,According to the Bank policy on Access to Information  audited financial statements  will be made public  
520,199,56  Project funds will be disbursed through advances to the DA  Direct Payments  and Reimbursement

577,216,64  The overall risk rating is Substantial  Key risks include  i  environmental and social   ii  stakeholders   iii   other  health security  and  iv  other  climate change   
578,217,65  Environmental and social  Substantial  This is mostly due to social risks  see Section V D for details on  risks and mitigation measures   
579,218,66  Stakeholders  Substantial  Violence is still widespread in the country  and conflicts might arise among  stakeholders in the project implementation area 
580,218,A significant challenge arises in working with diverse  stakeholders in the region 
581,218,Tensions persist between communities and sugar cane producers due to water usage  and the expansion of sugar cane fields 
582,218,Consequently  critical stakeholders  farmers  could oppose the proposed  changes and deny the project interventions and support 
583,218,As a mitigation strategy  building on the FCPF REDD   Readiness Preparation Project  MARN will continue a board consultation process involving various sectors and  working in the regional multi stakeholder environment 
584,218,The MRdR will allow stakeholders to be represented   creating an instance for collaboration with the MARN and MAG guidance 
585,218,Also  partial funding of restoration  activities will stimulate stakeholders  willingness to participate in the project interventions  
586,219,67  Other   COVID 19 pandemic  Substantial  The COVID 19 outbreak is not yet controlled and there are  lingering impacts 
587,219,Movement restrictions may reduce fieldwork and stakeholder participation  limitations in  response to the pandemic may affect populations  livelihoods  increasing pressure on natural resources and land   the GoES might shift resources to health and economic departments 
588,219,While the outbreak could be better  contained by the time the Project starts  early in 2022  its evolution actually remains uncertain62 
589,219,As a mitigation  measure  COVID 19 risk assessments and guidelines were developed and revised in direct coordination with the  GoES  health agencies and following the Bank s guidance 
590,219,These will be updated periodically during project  implementation 
591,219,In addition  by strengthening forest landscapes and ecosystem services  the proposed project  would be strengthening forests as a safety net for vulnerable rural population  as forests are sources of food   water  income  nutritional diversity  health  fiber  and energy for vulnerable rural population 
592,219,The ecological  recovery this project proposes would also contribute to enhancing the resilience of key sectors of the economy  such as sugarcane  basic grains  and cacao by promoting best practices for land restoration and integrating  compensation for environmental services 
594,220,68  Other   Climate Change  Substantial  The targeted landscape is exposed to climate induced extreme 
595,221,  62 Hence  by December 15th  2021  64  of the population were reported as fully vaccinated 
596,221,However  as many as 3 383 new  cases were still recorded during the last month  against 10 288 at the peak  in September 2020  source  John Hopkins University  of Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center

599,223,weather events  which are likely to be exacerbated by climate change  See Section 1  A  para 2  
600,223,Related events  could affect stakeholder participation  project implementation  and development outcomes 
601,223,As a mitigation  measure  a Climate Risk Assessment guided the project design 63 The sustainable agricultural practices promoted  by the Project will contribute to building resilience to the impacts of climate change by maintaining the essential  functions of the forest ecosystems  underpinning rural livelihoods subsistence and key sectors of the economy  such as agriculture  tourism  and infrastructure 
602,223,Also  sustainable management of natural resources through an  integrated landscape approach will help protect ecosystems and people s exposure to weather and physical  conditions caused by climate change 
603,223,This is consistent with the country s mitigation based adaptation approach  reflected in the NDC  which poses agriculture and water among the priority areas for climate action to promote  climate change adaptation

689,291,1 
690,291,Unplanned expansion of sugar cane and basic grain crops coupled with unsustainable production practices  are degrading land and ecosystems across the landscape  including mangroves and riparian forests  and are also  degrading biodiversity  including in agriculture ecosystems   as well as soil within farms  reducing their  productivity and sustainability 
691,291,Sugar cane expansion has also resulted in the direct conversion of mangrove  forests  and the displacement of traditional crops to higher mountain areas  which are consequently degraded  and affect the provision of hydrological services for the overall country s economy  and particularly for sugarcane  crops themselves 
692,291,Also  coffee agroforestry systems  which constitute an important area of the country s forest  cover and provide critical ecosystem services  are being degraded or replaced by pasture or crops without shade   further degrading and deforesting the landscape 
693,291,Solutions to this problem are constrained by  i  high vulnerability  to climate change and extreme weather events  especially droughts and floods  that prompt farmers to deforest  new land   ii  limited incentives to implement sustainable production practices that mainstream biodiversity  conservation and prevent land degradation   iii  lack of institutional capacities and financial resources to manage  ecosystem services at the landscape scale  including insufficient coordination between environmental and  agricultural policies   iv  perverse incentives with a focus on productivity and excess use of fertilizers  and  v   reduced opportunities for off farm employment  exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic  
695,292,2 
696,292,To address this issue  the proposed Project will work at a landscape scale to generate the enabling  conditions for integrated landscape management  pilot improved management practices  and promote  restoration of degraded lands and ecosystems 
697,292,It will also engage the private sector to adopt sustainable  production practices and invest in the conservation and restoration of ecosystems  targeting small farmers and  communities 
698,292,The Project will strengthen governance and technical capacities to manage natural resources at the  landscape scale by enhancing coordination of public institutions  particularly between the MARN  the MAG and  municipalities  and by generating technical capacities to mainstream biodiversity conservation and land  degradation considerations in natural resources management decisions and policies 
699,292,It will also promote private  financial mechanisms to restore degraded lands and preserve ecosystem services by working with sugar cane  producers who benefit from ecosystem services generated upstream  where healthy coffee agroforestry systems  and gallery forests are key for biodiversity conservation and water provision and regulation 
700,292,Additionally  technical  assistance will be provided to landscape dwellers to help them adopt SLM practices that mainstream biodiversity  conservation and LDN criteria  improving ecosystems  connectivity and reducing soil erosion at the farm level 
701,292,The  combined actions are expected to generate the financial and institutional conditions to ensure the sustainability  of restoration and conservation efforts over time  contributing to reinforce the conservation of critical biodiversity  and ecosystems  improve the provision of ecosystem services across the landscape and especially in downstream  areas  and upgrade the resilience of local communities to climate change and natural disasters 
703,293,3 
704,293,The success of these activities in achieving the ultimate outcomes will be dependent on the following  assumptions   i  The agricultural producers in the project area  and critically sugarcane producers  will be willing  to engage in activities and governance bodies  such as the MRdR    ii  the area will not face a significant outbreak  of violence on top of the present security conditions   iii  the relevant policies and programs established by the  GoES will remain stable  and  iv  COVID 19 pandemic restrictions will cease  allowing for fieldwork

709,296,El Salvador has a long history of anthropogenic intervention and land use change in its territory   composed of intricate mosaics that include forest patches  coffee farms  pasture  bushes  subsistence crops   and sugarcane  among others  while the remaining area of natural ecosystems is limited 
710,296,Land use is dominated  by agriculture 
711,296,Approximately 60 percent of the territory is used for agricultural production  and farms cover 80  percent of the land area in a diverse agriculture forest landscape64  See Figure 3 65 
712,296,Despite a decrease in the rate  of forest loss in recent years  from 2001 to 2018  El Salvador lost 74 400 ha of tree cover  equivalent to a 7 5  percent decrease in tree cover since 200066 
713,296,This places the country as the second most deforested in Latin  America 
714,296,Deforestation has also affected the country s coastal and marine forest resources  in the last five  decades  the country lost 60 percent of its mangroves  passing from almost 100 000 ha to only 40 000 ha67 
715,296, According to the 2018 National Forest Inventory  38 8 percent of the country is covered by forests 
716,296,However  most  of those forests are secondary  58 percent  and agroforestry systems of shade coffee  21 percent   and there is  important fragmentation of forest ecosystems 
717,296,Despite recent efforts to improve environmental sustainability  and restore degraded land  land use change remains a severe problem in the country as it drives land degradation  and threatens biodiversity

722,299,2  Agriculture makes a significant contribution to El Salvador s GDP and is an essential employment source   but its productivity is relatively low 
723,299,In 2016  the agriculture sector contributed 12 percent of the country s GDP   and 19 percent of the employed population is engaged in agriculture  fishing  and hunting 
724,299,In rural areas  that  number rises to 43 percent  and agricultural activities constitute the primary source of income68 
725,299,Due to its high  levels of independent and informal workforce  this sector is especially vulnerable to the effects of the quarantines  and macroeconomic disturbances provoked by the COVID 19 pandemic 
726,299,Subsistence agriculture is practiced by  350 000 producers in farms of less than three hectares and steep terrains  dominated by low productivity corn  crops 
727,299,Most family farms do not participate in producer associations  Only 8 percent have access to credit  and 10  percent have access to technical assistance69 
728,299,Coffee is the main product in terms of GDP contribution  but others  such as sugar cane are rapidly growing 
729,299,The agricultural sector receives direct and indirect incentives  which often  contradict the environmental commitments and objectives El Salvador has established in recent years   
730,300,3  Sugar cane expansion  crop  and harvest practices have been identified as one of the main current  threats to Salvadorian ecosystems 
731,300,Located mostly on the lower western and central lands  sugar cane  plantations have spread into the country s coastal territories 
732,300,They are primarily responsible for the clearing of  mangroves and riparian forests  From 2006 to 2015  sugar cane plantations increased from approximately 60 000  to 80 000 ha 
733,300,The country s Fifth Biodiversity Report found that 48 280 ha of deforestation between 2000 and  2010 were due to the expansion of sugarcane plantations70 
734,300,In terms of land degradation  unsustainable  agricultural practices such as burning crops before harvest  heavy usage of herbicides and pesticides  and poor  wastewater management practices generate soil erosion and mangroves  siltation  importantly affecting  biodiversity 
735,300,Erosion of soils and sedimentation of water leads to lower productivity rates  which farmers tend to  compensate for by further expanding their agricultural area into mangrove  ecotones areas  and gallery forests71 
736,300, Mangroves serve as an essential nursery habitat for fisheries and are rich in biodiversity and play an important  role in coastal communities by protecting shorelines from storm and hurricane winds  waves  and floods72 
737,300, Pressure on ecosystems may be accentuated in sugarcane and other crop areas because of the COVID 19  pandemic if unemployed workers return to rural areas or if the GoES increases assistance to secure food security  and employment 
739,301,4  In turn  land degradation affects the agricultural sector and increases the vulnerability of rural  communities 
740,301,Land degradation and soil erosion  exacerbated by recurrent flood and drought  adversely impact  agrarian production  further affecting the rural poor s livelihoods 
741,301,The National Development Plan  2014   identifies natural disasters as one of the greatest threats to human development  with a disproportionate impact  on the poor in combination with other factors like environmental degradation73 
742,301,Losses in infrastructure  crop  production  and water supply caused by extreme rainfall events and droughts since 2009 has affected the  economy by almost 1 percent74

753,305,Despite the development of multi stakeholder dialog supported by rigorous analysis to advance  restoration efforts  agricultural policies often contradict environmental objectives and commitments 
754,305,MAG  regulates land use planning for water  land  and forestry uses through the DGFCR 
755,305,These institutions often provide  direct and indirect support to both large scale and subsistence scale producers that do not consider environmental  elements  
756,306,6  Restoring ecosystems and landscapes to guarantee sustainable livelihoods is a national priority 
757,306,To  address the environmental sustainability challenges it faces  El Salvador is committed to reverse the degradation  process by setting ambitious targets to restore degraded land and mainstream biodiversity across the agricultural  and forestry sectors 
758,306,The main components of the 2012 National Environmental Policy are the restoration and  conservation of ecosystems to reduce risks while sustaining productive activities and ensuring the well being of  the population 
759,306,Within this framework  the PREP was developed in synergy with key biodiversity  environmental   water and sanitation  and climate change strategies 
760,306,The PREP is already being translated into action  MARN has  been working with different partners to design and implement instruments to strengthen and prioritize PREP  actions 
761,306,The PREP applies the ROAM to determine and analyze restoration options based on biophysical  social   and economic criteria75 
762,306,As a result  restoration actions have been implemented in 241 662 ha of degraded land  across the country in the 2014 2019 period76 
763,306,Under a coordinated and synergistic approach  in El Salvador   restoration initiatives are contributing to recover and conserve biodiversity  rehabilitating degraded lands   supporting the climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies  and advancing towards Goal 15 of Aichi of  the Convention on Biological Diversity 
765,307,7  To reduce land degradation and restore degraded land  El Salvador updated the PANSAL and has  developed an ambitious National Restoration Plan 
766,307,El Salvador is committed to LDN  and it will be a pilot country  in the implementation of the LDN Framework under the UNCCD 
767,307,The country is updating the PANSAL  developing  a national strategy  country objectives  and voluntary targets that align with this project to achieve this objective 
768,307, Moreover  as part of the Bonn Challenge  the country pledged to restore one million hectares of land by 203077 
769,307, The MARN presented in 2017 the National REDD  EN REP to meet its ecosystem restoration commitments 
770,307,The  EN REP aims at restoring the ecosystem functions of the country s degraded lands to reduce the loss and damage  caused by natural and climate related disaster risks  increase the country s carbon stocks and capture rate  pursue  sustainable economic activities and protected infrastructure investments  and ensure the overall well being of  the population 
771,307,In the same year  the MARN launched the 2018 2022 National Ecosystem Restoration Plan  which  includes an economic analysis of the actions for the restoration of landscapes and promotes improved agricultural  practices that reduce land degradation 
773,308,8  A PDLS aims to improve coordination at the regional level and guide new investments on restoration  efforts in the Conservation Areas 
774,308,The PDLS are developed using Miradi s open standards methodology78 
775,308,Each  PDLS has two areas of work   i  the protection  increase and restoration of forest ecosystems to ensure ecosystem  services  conserve biodiversity  and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and increase of  carbon reserves  and  ii  the transformation of traditional productive systems into agroecological or sustainable  systems that contribute to improving the quality of life for the human population 
776,308,The methodology for planning  and implementing restoration actions follows four stages   i  a participatory and inclusive analysis of the region s  vulnerability and environmental degradation  to identify priority issues to be addressed   ii  identify priority sites

783,311,Prior to implementation on the ground  strategic alliances and coordination mechanisms  are established  backed up by signed agreements or Memorandums of Understanding 
784,311,Finally  the stakeholders  organize the necessary logistics  particularly the nurseries that will provide material to the different initiatives  
785,312,9  Over the last decade  the sugar cane industry has adopted more socially and environmentally friendly  practices 
786,312,FUNDAZUCAR and CONSAA began in 2012 the process of building the sustainability strategy of the sugar  agroindustry  aiming to achieve a more sustainable and resilient agriculture 
787,312,FUNDAZUCAR developed a Manual  of Good Practices79  which integrates environment criteria  including green harvest techniques   with a  perspective to progressively adopt a territorial approach  i e   water basin  and to contribute to comply with the  country s SDG commitments 
788,312,The manual was developed with support from GIZ  IDB  and FUNDEMAS  More  recently  the sugar cane industry started to certify its sustainability under the Bonsucro International Standard80   
789,313,10  The Project will be implemented across selected areas in the EIBSCA  See Figure 4   The area contains a  population of 198 556 concentrated in rural areas 
790,313,The land s topography is mostly flat in the south  increasing  altitude progressively towards the north  reaching a peak of 1844 meters 
791,313,About 41 percent of the tree cover   28 690 ha  is in conservation areas  concentrated in southern mangroves  and dispersed as patches in the north

796,316,   The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration  P170854  
797,317,continued deforestation to produce basic grains for subsistence has aggravated erosion in the high areas of the  region 
798,317,The pressure of recent droughts and extreme weather events that lead to landslides combined with these  factors to exacerbate land degradation 
799,317,Meanwhile  in the lower elevations  traditional cultures have been lost to  sugarcane  which is implemented at medium and large scales  and requires unique management approaches 
800,317,The  region is characterized for containing an entire water basin and connecting the practices of subsistence basic grain  producers with sugarcane producers through water  requiring an integrated landscape management approach 
802,318,12  Specific municipalities and basins were selected based on a ROAM analysis and based on FIAES   experiences restoring land in the region 
803,318,Component 1 will be implemented across the entire landscape  focusing  on the municipalities of San Pedro Puxtla  Guaymango  Jujutla  San Francisco Men ndez  and Ataco 
804,318,Component  2 will be implemented in the municipalities of Acajutla  San Francisco Men ndez  and Jujutla 
805,318,These areas have  been prioritized considering water recharge areas  riparian forests  and biological corridors 
806,318,Similarly  areas in and  around sugar cane plantation in the lower basin and coastal municipalities were prioritized on crop areas with  degraded lands and targeting those close to fragile ecosystems 
807,318,The Project area of influence totals 67 655 362  ha  See Table 1

814,325,14  The activities under Component 1 will improve the conditions to mainstream biodiversity and address  land degradation 
815,325,This will be achieved by laying the foundations to promote and implement land use practices  to avoid  reduce  and reverse land degradation 
816,325,They will directly contribute to PANSAL components 4   strengthening institutional capacities and human resources for sustainable land use management  and 5   generating  systematizing  and disseminating information related to land degradation to monitor landscape  sustainability effectively  
818,326,15  A variety of bilateral arrangements will be established for collaboration between MARN  MAG agencies   and municipalities 
819,326,These will be implemented at regional and local levels and promote the involvement of private  institutions such as NGOs  universities  and companies  to support the limited capacities of CENTA in the region 
820,326, Collaboration with MAG will improve coordination between ministries for land use planning  landscape  and  ecosystem restoration  including PREP   as well as technology transfer activities 
821,326,Local governments   municipalities  involvement in planning restoration will be promoted through local environmental governance  instances and the collaboration with NGOs 
822,326,For this activity  the Project will finance  i  the development of 
823,327,  The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration  P170854  
824,328,collaboration agreements  including the appropriate implementation plans  costs  and finance opportunities   ii   consulting support for the development of three PLAS   iii  logistic support for vigilance  inspection  and  participation activities as determined in the collaboration agreements  and  iv  tools and equipment for the  activities determined in the local work plans 
826,329,16  In parallel  local participatory governance instances will be strengthened  specifically the COAL81  the Barra  de Santiago Ramsar committee  and the water boards 
827,329,This activity will promote the participation of vulnerable  populations such as women  young and indigenous communities 
828,329,The actions to be financed include   i  the  operations of the COAL and the Ramsar committee   ii  implementing an education plan  developed separately   see paragraph 25  for water boards participants  to provide them with knowledge of restoration and sustainable  practices  including CES  governance for climate resilience  and adaptive management   and highlight the role of  women and indigenous communities in landscape management   iii  diverse technical support for environmental  governance in the region  promoting the participation of public institutions and NGOs  and  iv  updating a PLAS  and producing two new ones in Barra de Santiago  Metalio and Garita Palmera  to guide family scale sustainable  practices for the extraction of non timber products from mangrove forests 
830,330,17  The Project will also contribute to the design  implementation  coordination  and technical assistance of  the MRdR and the private sector forum 
831,330,The MRdR will be established through COAL  for the Ahuachap n  Coordination area or a Restauration RoundTable  and will liaise with the Ahuachap n Coordination Roundtable   which incorporates relevant national institutions and international agencies that implement projects in the area   e g   GIZ  UNDP and IUCN   by relying on advice from it and  through it  building synergies with other projects in  the area 
832,330,Similarly  it will be supported by the Roundtable of Irrigators from Ahuachap n  which integrates the  local water boards to manage water resources 
833,330,The MRdR will integrate representatives of MARN  MAG  including  CENTA and DGFCR   institutions driving other local projects  e g   FIAES  UNDP  FAO   and the relevant local  instances for each selected basin or Municipality 
834,330,New alliances and improved coordination will be pursued  between local water boards and the private sector actors intervening in the landscape  mainly sugar cane  producers   promoting investments in the conservation of water recharge and important biodiversity areas 
836,331,18  Creating awareness among the public and especially the agricultural producer in the area is considered a  key step for the Project s successful implementation 
837,331,To achieve this  the valuation of local ecosystem services  and examples of successful CES projects will be studied and communicated 
838,331,A consultant will study the benefits  of ecosystem services for the population in the area  positive restoration actions carried out in the past  and their  impacts of degradation 
839,331,Communication of this information through an environmental education plan will aim to  increase awareness on the contribution of ecosystem services to the rural and IP s subsistence and culture  as  well as the relevance of participative and inclusive governance 
840,331,This plan will finance the preparation and  dissemination of information about SLM practices  restoration  the value of ecosystem services  land tenure  security and related gender equality issues 
841,331,This activity includes  i  preparing a study of the economic value of  ecosystem services and the benefits of successful restoration projects   ii  developing a communication plan for  the results of the study   iii  providing capacities for local communication agents   iv  preparing graphical  promotional products  and  v  implementing the campaign through local and regional media 
843,332,19  The public institutions capacity to evaluate restoration and sustainable land use at the landscape scale  will allow for improved management and public policy decisions 
844,332,The activities to achieve this would be   i  with

848,335,the support of external consultants  the ISR will be strengthened by including specific biodiversity and land  degradation considerations to the existing variables  and the information required to feed the index with these  new variables will be collected or generated 
849,335,This will help assess and monitor the state and trajectory of  sustainability conditions in the landscape  considering environmental  social  and economic criteria at the  landscape level 
850,335,The ISR will be used to monitor the total project area  67 655 36 ha  
851,335,In addition   ii  the capacity  to generate the information and regularly assess the sustainability of the landscape through this index will be  strengthened by training the personnel of the local governments and public institutions involved and acquiring  the necessary equipment for its efficient implementation 
852,335,The landscape sustainability index will have the  potential to become a tool to demonstrate sustainability factors from the agricultural products harvested in the  landscape  constituting an enabling factor to access specialized markets for sustainably sourced products 
854,336,20  A series of private CES agreements will be supported  as pilots  to provide sustainable financial resources  for the restoration and conservation of essential water related ecosystem services 
855,336,This scheme will  i  provide  support of the MARN and the MRdR for the establishment of the agreements  and  ii  identify potential financial  or investment sources for restoration 
856,336,It will further be supported by  iii  facilitating the negotiations between  water boards  sugarcane  and cattle farmers  including the support for technical and financial proposals for the  biodiversity and water related uses  and  iv  aggregating offer through multi stakeholder coalitions that will be  trained to negotiate larger and more convenient CES 
857,336,The outcome of these negotiations will be captured through   v  the formulation of an integrated plan for environmental compensation in the area  with the support of public  institutions  which will help secure these agreements  sustainability and promote other agreements in the future

934,372,27  Formulation of PLAS for mangroves requires involving mangrove users  communities that benefit from  the consumption of shellfish and crabs 
935,372,The planning process builds on relevant studies and data on population  and morphometric characteristics  carried out with the participation of local stakeholders  puncheros and  curileros   it also utilizes information from inventories of the harvesting and fishing practices and gear used by the  communities  as well as the curileros and puncheros  which specify the species used by each one of them 
936,372,In this  process  it is of utmost importance to establish agreements to promote sustainable use of resources among  communities 
937,372,These agreements address the spatio temporal regulation of activities to achieve established goals  of mangrove protection  management  and use  defining the permitted sizes and maximum allowable numbers   and adopting zoning guidelines and  on some occasions  closed periods 
938,372,This planning process aim at achieving a  meaningful involvement of local stakeholders in sustainable use of mangrove  while supporting their livelihoods  
939,373,28  Subcomponent 2 2 will focus on sugarcane production  aiming at implementing sustainable practices that  incorporate biodiversity considerations  in the industry at the regional scale 
940,373,This will be achieved through  technical support in alignment with the BONSUCRO standard for large producers 
941,373,Small and medium scale  producers will also receive technical support to improve their practices in pilot areas critical for the provision of  ecosystem services and serve as biological corridors   
942,374,29 
943,374,The Project will also support the development of a roadmap for implementing the BONSUCRO standard  at the national level  taking advantage of the experiences and working methods of FUNDAZUCAR and CONSAA 
944,374,It  will include institutional coordination to support an observatory that facilitates monitoring of the sector s  sustainability actions  and the consequent generation of sector recommendations to develop policies and plans 
946,375,30 
947,375,The Project will implement a plan for advising and generating technical capacities for associations of  sugarcane producers and the representatives who will support the implementation of sustainable practices and  biodiversity criteria in sugarcane production 
948,375,It will hire specialists to guide the training with the support of MAG   FIAES  NGOs from the sugarcane sector  such as FUNDEMAS and FUNDAZUCAR  as well as other local NGOs 
949,375,It will  target 250 sugarcane producers and agreements with the local industry  Ingenio Central Izalco    
950,376,31  Demonstrative sustainable management projects will be selected from organizations of small sugarcane  producers and single small or medium scale producers 
951,376,These will be targeted at mangrove buffer areas and  gallery forests around rivers 
952,376,Activities include developing improved agro silvo pastoral practices and improving  landscape connectivity through native patches of forest and sediment erosion control 
953,376,This process includes  financing a diagnostic of the current conditions and compatible land use arrangements  and technical assistance  for implementing the selected arrangements

957,379,1  Differences in gender roles in rural communities have led male and female jobs to have considerably different  wages  leadership  and safety conditions 
958,379,El Salvador has made significant efforts to recognize and advance women s  rights by signing and ratifying major international treaties and including them in domestic legislation 
959,379,However   improvements in the legal framework have not resulted in comparable progress in gender equality of endowments  such  as health  education  economic opportunities  family dynamics  voice  and agency 
960,379,Females also face limited  participation in rural organizations and access to land  In addition  males are significantly more likely to migrate than  females

963,381,2  In rural El Salvador  women s economic empowerment and participation in economic activities are challenged  by land rights  meaningful involvement in unpaid activities  and low access to education 
964,381,Women often do not obtain  or enjoy the benefits of their participation in agricultural production  which partly leads them to rely on additional  income and take care of other responsibilities  household chores  family care  food  etc   
965,381,In addition to attending to  household chores  many rural women perform unpaid work alongside men on farms and livestock farms  planting   weeding  harvesting  raising livestock  feeding  and caring for sick animals  as well as cooking for other agricultural  workers 
966,381,Some women also work outside the home making clothes  or as employees or owners of specific stores  such  as supermarkets or kiosks   or as administrative assistants  among other activities     3

1048,433,1  The WB incorporates GHG emission accounting for all investment project financing since 2012  and GEF projects  are included in this standard 
1049,433,Emission reductions are increasingly relevant for mitigating climate change and can only  be effectively managed if GHG emissions are quantified and monitored 
1050,433,The bank adopted EX ACT as the default tool  for quantifying GHG emissions related to agriculture  reforestation  and land use 
1051,433,The tool was developed by the FAO  in 2010 to assess the impact of agricultural investment lending on GHG emissions and carbon sequestration 
1052,433,EX ACT  allows the assessment of a project s net carbon balance  defined as the net balance of CO2 equivalent that was emitted  or sequestered because of project implementation compared to a without project scenario 
1053,433,It then estimates the  carbon stock changes  emissions or sinks   expressed in equivalent tons of CO2 per hectare and year  including  uncertainties  See Tables 9 and 10   
1054,434,2  This GEF project aims at promoting improved agricultural practices and restoring degraded landscapes in EIBSCA 
1055,434, It is designed to support the sustainable management of basins and retain the provision of ecosystem services  while  improving productive economic activities for basic grains  cacao and sugarcane based on improved and integrated  management of water and soil 
1056,434,The EX ACT v8 5 4 tool was used to assess the GHG impacts associated with the  investment activities  
1057,435,3  Project boundaries  The GHG accounting analysis considers activities under Component 2 
1058,435,Although Component  1 will create enabling conditions that will promote improved landscape management  which are expected to reduce  emissions  these are not measurable 
1059,435,Specifically  the CES agreements under Component 1 will likely reduce emissions   and potentially increase carbon sequestration  but these are not yet defined and therefore  were excluded from the  analysis 
1060,435,On the other hand  Component 2 will restore and improve practices in 930 ha  restore further 70 ha  and  produce demonstrative plots for sugarcane and other cultures 
1061,435,Moreover  support for the implementation of  BONSUCRO 5 1 practices in sugarcane fields is expected to reach at least half  3 300 ha  of the land managed by farmers  that already demonstrated interest 
1062,435,Other activities will not be included since there is no set goal expected to be  reached 
1063,435,For example  capacity building activities and awareness campaigns are expected to increase the uptake of  sustainable management practices across the landscape  but the effects are hard to predict   
1064,436,  4  Basic assumptions  Soil type was selected as Low Activity Clay based on FAO s EX ACT maps  which is the dominant  soil type in area 
1065,436,The project s implementation period is five years  and the capitalization of the investments were  calculated for 15 years after project completion  thus  the GHG analysis was conducted for a 20 year period 
1066,436,The   without project scenario  is assumed to be equal to a  no project scenario  or  business as usual  
1067,436,This default  assumption is deemed reasonable as changes in agricultural activity crucially depend on information  knowledge  and  technology available to beneficiaries  which are expected contributions of the Project 
1069,437,5  Inputs to the analysis 
1070,437,The project interventions will directly target an estimated area of 1 020 ha  including  restoration and adoption of improved production practices on 520 ha of basic grains agroforestry and 140 ha of cacao  agroforestry in the upper watershed  20 ha of sugarcane plantations and 200 ha of agro silvo pastoral production 
1071,437, Agro silvo pastoral practices are expected to be extended to 2 000 heads of cattle 
1072,437,The improvements include  sustainable management of soil  tillage  nutrient application   selection of improved genetic material  and agroforestry  linked to sustainable cacao production 
1073,437,It also considers the restoration of 50 ha of gallery forests and 30 ha of  mangrove forests 
1074,437,Indirectly a much larger area is expected to be improved through capacity building  implementing  BONSUCRO certification for sugarcane  raising awareness across small scale farmers  and demonstrative activities 
1076,438,  The World Bank   El Salvador Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration  P170854  
1077,439,Over 6 600 are already implementing BONSUCRO 4 1 and have demonstrated interest in applying improved practices 
1078,439,  For deforestation  the analysis assumes the Project would lead to a 50 percent reduction of the average annual  national deforestation rate of 0 54 percent both for dry tropical forest  Gallery  and mangroves  See Table 8  90 Table  9 provides results on the targeted systems

1085,445,support to transition to reach an Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration in targeted areas of the 
1086,446,seven municipalities  The land areas would continue on a decreasing track of ecosystem health and sustainability 
1087,447,of the agriculture and cattle ranching that would lead to further pressure on the agriculture frontier  conventional 
1088,448,agricultural practices would continue to low tree cover on productive lands and thus limited capacity to absorb 
1089,449,carbon  a limited number of sustainable forest operations would be incorporated into the economic activities of 
1090,450,local communities  and  therefore  land use conversion would remain subject to agricultural activities with 
1091,451,2  For this analysis  a  business as usual  baseline case is used that assumes that future development trends 
1092,452,follow those of the past and no changes in policies and practices will take place  In developing countries  land use 
1093,453,patterns are changing quickly  so in this analysis as well  it is more relevant to use recent past trends than long 
1094,454,term past trends  Thus  this analysis uses recent trends of long term trends as the recent changes seem to be

1103,463,financial sustainability  The government budget is limited  but the Project will support alternative instruments to 
1104,464,overcome any further limitation  involving new cross sectoral actors to address policies related to integrated 
1105,465,landscape management  Without the Project  the budget forecast to be allocated for conservation of land areas 
1106,466,by the GoES  baseline scenario  would be limited  The proposed GEF investment would leverage additional 
1107,467,resources from other partners over the same period  This financing will help develop the necessary institutional 
1108,468,capabilities  set up policy frameworks for sustainable productive areas  and develop mechanisms for sustainable 
1109,469,5  To simplify the incremental economic analysis of the Project  assumptions were used taking account the 
1110,470,possible benefits in the project sites  The Project is expected to provide three economic benefit streams   i  
1111,471,ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits provided by Integrated Landscape Management   ii  carbon storage 
1112,472,and sequestration by sustainable practices and restoration  and  iii  mangrove restoration and activities at

1115,475,returns  In direct terms  the first benefit is related with Component 2  the second  with both components  while 
1116,476,the third benefit is most associated with Component 1   
1117,477,6  Ecosystem services and Biodiversity benefit stream  For this stream  improved sustainable practices 
1118,478,provide many ecosystem services that are necessary for social and economic wellbeing  These services include 
1119,479,water filtration and storage  cleaning air  soil formation  recreation  food  and timber 91 Much of the El Salvador 
1120,480,state s economy depends on the natural  resources  products  and productive activities developed in the 
1121,481,watersheds basins  To estimate the benefits associated to this benefit stream  the total hectares of landscapes 
1122,482,under improved sustainable practices intervened by the Project are considered as defined in the Results

1139,498,It is estimated that 0 2 tons ha year will be avoided in the total area intervened in the Project  including the 
1140,499,reduction of degradation  loss of ecosystems  and sustainable productive practices  over 20 years   
1141,500,9  Monetary values were estimated based on the carbon social price 96Here it is used US 60 t C as an upper 
1142,501,bound and US 40 t Carbon as a lower bound  Additionally  the value of voluntary carbon market US 3 01 
1143,502,t Carbon  which do not include that social part  was added in the analysis as an alternative case 97 According to 
1144,503,the High Level Commission on Carbon Prices  it is recommended that the Project s economic analysis use a low 
1145,504,and high estimate of the carbon price and take a value that is consistent with achieving the core objective of the 
1146,505,Paris Agreement of keeping temperature rise below 2 degrees  Therefore  a higher value  US 60  was taken as an 
1147,506,10  Producer Level and Mangrove Restoration Benefit Stream  Major activities under this section are related 
1148,507,to investments on improved sustainable productive practices for coffee  cacao  sugar cane  and basic grain 
1149,508,producer groups as well as agro silvo pastoral and agroforestry systems  and mangrove restoration  Therefore  
1150,509,these activities supported under each component bring social  financial  and environmental benefits  The benefit 
1151,510,of producer groups activities is found by comparing the situation with and without the Project   
1152,511,11  In simple terms  there are two ways to assess economically this benefit stream   i  estimating the 
1153,512,difference of benefits between conventional  current or baseline scenario  and regenerative production practices 
1154,513, sustainable practice scenario   or  ii  taking a percentage that represents an improvement in benefits for adopting

1160,516,regenerative production practices compared to conventional  In this sense  for this economic analysis  it is 
1161,517,considered an increase in their productivity by at least 10 percent   
1162,518,12  There are five types of activities to be financed at the producer level   a  cacao   b  basic grains   c  sugar 
1163,519,cane production   d  agro silvo pastoral system  and  e  gallery forests  In addition to this  mangroves restoration 
1164,520,is included as one more activity in the total intervened areas  These six activities were chosen because they are 
1165,521,related to the sustainable management of land use  Figure 10 shows the distribution of land use types and their

1168,524,Also  in this case  it is assumed that the total area is based on the distribution of the Results Framework  
1169,525,13 
1170,525,The economic value of these six types of selected activities is obtained from a national study of financial   environmental  and social benefits of nine restoration actions that are part of the Action Plan for Restoration of  Ecosystems and Landscapes of El Salvador  in compliance with the country s commitment in the framework of the  Bonn Challenge to restore one million ha98 
1171,525,It is one of the first economic analyzes of the restoration actions  completed under the ROAM framework     14 
1172,525,Specifically  these economic values were obtained from different agricultural products of El Salvador   considering their characteristic benefits and costs 
1173,525,The social annual flows  which include both  social and private  returns  for all the economic activities assessed are taken from Raes et al 
1174,525, 2017  99 Here it was taken the values  of Cacao Production Activities  US 25 984 ha year   Agro silvo pastoral system  US  20 275 ha year   Mangrove  Restoration  US 6 906 ha year  
1175,525,The values for basic grains  gallery forests and sugar cane production activities  do not show a significant change in the eleven year period of the study  however  they could present an increase  of the benefits in a much longer period

1181,528,15  A 20 year period is assumed to assess the economic feasibility of the Project 
1182,528,It is also assumed there are  no further incremental changes of project generated benefits beyond the 20 year project evaluation period 
1183,528, While the project costs are only assumed to emerge for the five years of project implementation  the benefits and  opportunity costs are assumed to be generated beyond the implementation period 
1184,528,Project costs over the  implementation period are approximated considering the project financing of US  3 56 million by GEF 
1185,528,Also  an  assumption of two percent  as an additional operating cost  were added along with the projection of a 20 year  project evaluation that will be added for the incremental economic analysis   
1186,529,16  A sensitivity analysis is applied for the main simulation parameters  notably the discount rate and project 
1187,530,horizon  to assess project robustness  For the discount rate  alternative rates of six and nine percent are applied  
1188,531,In addition to varying discount rates  simulation results are tested against changing the project horizon  10 and 20 
1189,532,years   This set of sensitivity assessments enables a comprehensive analysis of the economic robustness of the 
1190,533,Project in relation to the changing or differentiated value parameters  All sensitivity analyses are run for all 
1191,534,17  Table 12 shows baseline results as well as a sensitivity analysis  The first panel shows the 20 year baseline  scenario  The second panel reduces further project lifetime to ten years 
1192,534,All the case scenarios are positive  suggesting that the Project creates more benefits than costs 
1193,534,At the same time  increasing the discount rate from  six to nine percent  reducing the carbon social price by 33 percent  from US 60 to US 40  as well as adopting the  value of voluntary carbon market  US  3 01  and using more conservative estimates regarding the value of  ecosystem services provided  upper bound and lower bound   do not substantially affect the estimates

1202,541,This incremental economic analysis for the Project in El Salvador shows substantial benefits for  beneficiaries in areas served by the Project  as well as substantial benefits for the Salvadoran society 
1203,541,Overall  the  NPV is projected to reach US  4 4 million  lower bound   and US  5 1 million  upper bound  in the baseline scenario   20 years  carbon social price of US  60  and 6 percent discount rate  
1204,541,The investments evaluated for the economic  and financial analysis will generate a Benefit Cost ratio between 2 18 and 2 37  and an IRR between 23 percent  and 25 percent 
1205,541,The economic and financial analysis thus shows that if Project implementation is effective and  efficient  Project supported investments will bring substantial financial and economic benefits to small scale farm  producers in the Project area and to Salvadoran society in general 
1207,542,19 
1208,542,The results of the quantitative simulations are robust in terms of sensitivity analyses  assuming different  project years and discount rates  varying Benefit Cost ratio between 1 16 and 2 37  and an IRR between 15 percent  and 25 percent 
1209,542,Throughout the analysis  the benefit assumptions were based on the values of ecosystem services  and carbon sequestration in El Salvador by recognized studies  
1210,543,20  Estimates shown correspond to a lower bound as they represent the benefit streams derived from  Components 1 and 2 applying a very conservative approach 
1211,543,The economic value of project is likely to be higher  since the analysis did not include in the calculations other non economic global and local benefits such as the  value of the resulting improvement in food security  among other benefits 
1212,543,Certainly  it is expected that  Component 3 will have additional benefits  but they are difficult to measure due to the social and environmental  qualitative approach  based on project management 
1213,543,Worth noting  this last component is needed to carry out  the main components and the overall project activities efficiently to thus achieving the desired results through  the strengthening of business skills for sustainable rural production and the project coordination  monitoring  and  evaluation 
1215,544,21  Additional incremental benefits can be associated with incremental economic benefits arising from better 
1216,545,public service delivery resulting from the Integrated Landscape Management and Restoration through CES that 
1217,546,incentive the capacity building of small scale farm producers embedded in all the project components  In 
1218,547,summary  this project will benefit the sustainable development of El Salvador  providing long term benefits to
