28,15,  C 2  revised to read  Provision of equipment for the construction of wastewater treatment plants   
29,16,The project description was further amended in May  2002  following the October 2001 Mid Term Review 
30,16, While the  text of this change was not available for review  the ICR reports that it cancelled remaining funds for ASMIDAL and   ENSIDER  on the understanding that the companies would complete their investments with their own resources  and   reallocated  10 5 million for a new component  A 2 Hazardous Waste Management  to establish a pilot hazardous  waste treatment facility 
31,16, The ICR is not clear whether this is the same facility as that described in the SAR under  V 
32,16, The Government s Parallel Program in Skikda  which includes production changes at a chlorine plant to avoid the use   of mercury  decontamination of the plant and construction of an engineered landfill for the disposal of   mercury comtaminated sludge  and was at that time intended to be carried out with government and other funds  
33,16,  However  a communication from the region has clarified that the new component did constitute the engineered landfill   referred to in the SAR but that the site was changed from Skikda to another site  causing considerable delays

35,17,   Comments on Project Cost  Financing  Borrower Contribution  and DatesComments on Project Cost  Financing  Borrower Contribution  and DatesComments on Project Cost  Financing  Borrower Contribution  and DatesComments on Project Cost  Financing  Borrower Contribution  and Dates        it is not clear from the ICR whether these figures include relevant expenditures by the enterprises ASMIDAL and   ENSIDER after the May 2002 amendment The region has clarified that only  someexpenditures are included 
36,17,    From the ICR text  Section 5 4 
37,17, Annex 2 gives a total disbursement of  22 34 m but the sub totals add to  23 50  m  a rounding error  according to the region   The original project cost estimates and financing plan appear to have been realistic  though the project scope was   perhaps more ambitious than could have been implemented  
38,17, The documents reviewed do not mention whether   efforts were made to attract grant cofinancing  which might have made borrowing for environmental protection more   palatable 
39,17, The decision to use an extended implementation period of eight years was justified by events  
40,17, Even  though the loan closed on time  the hazardous waste component added in  2002  had not proceeded beyond the   bidding stage by loan closure 
41,18, 3  Relevance of Objectives   Design   The project was consistent with the Bank s  1996 CAS and with Algeria s environmental management priorities  
42,18, The  combination of legal and institutional strengthening with action to mitigate two major pollution sources was both   appropriate and even necessary to ensure government commitment to borrowing for technical assistance activities  
43,18,  The selection of ASMIDAL and ENSIDER also appears to have been appropriate  given the highly adverse impacts   their emissions were having on surrounding populations  as was the use of environmental audits to determine which   of the pollution problems should be tackled first  although the subsequent reduction in project scope may indicate   that the enterprises were less committed to the project objectives than first appeared  
44,18, Though not emphasized in the  SAR  the selection of investments which had worthwhile financial returns   through energy savings or resource   recovery  must have eased enterprise cooperation  
45,18, While the SAR identified the main risks to timely and successful   project implementation  with hindsight it can be seen that the actions taken were insufficient to prevent major delays   and uncertainties during the early implementation period  
46,18, A smaller project might have reduced the political and   institutional risks 
47,19, 4 
48,19,Achievement of Objectives  Efficacy    Despite some reductions in project scope  the project achieved all three of its development objectives  though not to   the full extent envisaged at appraisal  
49,19, In particular  the ICR has no useful data on the achievement of the target of   reducing ENSIDER dust emissions from 40 000 ton yr to 11 000 ton yr 
50,19, However  the measured health impacts were   impressive  especially in the villages closest to the plants  
51,19, As the hazardous waste facility had not been built at the   time of loan closure  its outcome remains uncertain  though there is evidence that Algeria is strongly committed to its   completion and the Bank is continuing to supply non  lending services 
52,20,Although Section 4 2 of the ICR does not clearly compare project outcomes with SAR projections  it appears that all  
53,21,the legislative  institutional targets were achieved fully or in part and  in some cases  exceeded  
54,21, Given the embryonic  state of environmental management in Algeria when the project was prepared  it appears to have played a key role in   building national capacity  not least of which in the establishment of a credible compliance system for environmental   laws 
55,22, 5 
56,22,Efficiency   While recognizing the expected benefits of legal and institutional strengthening  the SAR understandably focused its   quantitative analysis on the investment components and estimated economic rates of return of  29  for ASMIDAL  and 49  for ENSIDER based essentially on health benefits and some productivity benefits  
57,22, The ICR uses a broader  definition of benefits  including additional productivity gains and benefits to fisheries  which seem unquestionable  
58,22,  More doubtful is the inclusion of increases in real estate values  
59,22, The ICR does not demonstrate that such increases   were a result of the project and  even if they were  they may represent double counting  
60,22, More generally  the ICR  does not present its results in a form directly comparable with the SAR  uses an opportunity cost of capital of  10   rather than the 12  used at appraisal  misleadingly states that a financial rate of return was not calculated in the   SAR and was therefore not included in the ICR  the region has clarified that the actual reason was the   non availability of financial data from the enterprises    and presents no estimates at all for the added hazardous   waste component  though apparently a financial analysis was undertaken  
61,22, Moreover  Annex 3 consists only of  tables  without any explanatory notes on assumptions or methodology and therefore cannot be independently   checked 
62,23,The following table tries to compare the  a priori and a postieri estimates of project efficiency

67,28,  Direct benefits plus avoided costs   not further defined in the ICR  but needs further review to see if it includes   double counting   Excludes hazardous waste 
68,28,   A communication from the region states that   A pre feasibility study was carried out that established the financial   viability of the project from a private sector operator point of view   and that later  ways to provide incentives were  assessed  
69,29,Despite the ICR methodological and presentational deficiencies noted above  the evidence is clear that the ASMIDAL   and ENSIDER components were economically justified and anecdotal evidence   including the fact that the  enterprises were willing to complete the investments with their own funds   suggests that they were also viable in   financial terms   in other words   win win  solutions 
70,30, 6  M E Design  Implementation    Utilization  The SAR  Annex 5  gave a reasonable set of performance indicators and required that progress towards their   achievement be reported quarterly  
71,30, However  apart from including a pilot monitoring system in Annaba under   component A 3  the SAR does not describe how M E would be carried out  
72,30, The ICR briefly mentions that an air   quality monitoring network was set up for Annaba and various laboratories established but there is no mention of   water monitoring  though the region has clarified that water monitoring has intensified   
73,30, The ICR presentation on key  performance indicators is roughly comparable to the SAR format  but no results are presented for the following   dust  emissions from ENSIDER  a key pollutant   nitrogen oxides  and water pollution from oil and total suspended solids  
74,30,  The reported SO2 emissions are 8 000 ton yr  exactly the appraisal estimate  apparently an error    However  some  useful health indicators are added in the ICR  
75,31, 7 
76,31,Other  Safeguards  Fiduciary  Unintended Impacts  Positive   Negative    Safeguards The SAR has just two sentences on environmental impacts  though a much better section on social impacts    especially employment  
77,31, EA Category B was appropriate for the project as appraised  but should have been   changed to A when the hazardous waste component was added  it is not clear from the ICR whether this happened  
78,31,  The region has clarified that the management memo requesting approval for the project restructuring explicitly   mentions that the project would be changed to A but this apparently was not reflected in the SAP  
79,31, The region has  stated that the EA work done was of A category standards  including appropriate public consultation    
80,32,The use of environmental audits for the two enterprises to characterize the pollution issues  set priorities and form   the basis for the design of Component B was very appropriate and pioneering for Algeria  
81,32,   Also pioneering was the  use of environmental management performance agreements for the two enterprises and later for  25 additional firms 
82,32,  There is no specific reference to measures to minimize negative environmental impacts of the project investments    that is  an Environmental Management Plan   though one outcome of the ENSIDER component was said to be    targeted environmental management measures   
83,32, This would surely have been an issue for the hazardous waste   component but no appraisal document   or even detailed description  for that investment was available for review    though it apprently exists in project files  
84,32,   The SAR makes no reference to other safeguard policies and it is unlikely   that they should have been triggered for this project  
85,33,Despite the recommendations of the ICR guidelines  the ICR makes no reference at all to safeguard policies  the   extent to which they were applied  implementation experience and any unexpected negative outcomes  
86,34,Fiduciary Issues At appraisal  the project had relatively standard requirements for accounts and audits  reporting  and procurement    which were revised through an amendment to the legal agreements on February  19  1999   and depended on a new  PIU in an agency with almost no experience with international assistance  
87,34, The reported difficulties and delays in   procurement are therefore not surprising    The ICR does not report any misprocurement or other fiscal irregularities  
88,34,  The covenant on debt service coverage for ASMIDAL and ENSIDER was deleted when they agreed to complete the   project investments with their own funds

102,42,project  which balances capacity building with investments in pollution reduction   2 
103,42,  Picking the  low hanging fruit  in pollution reduction investments can often yield solutions that are financially   profitable for the enterprise  as well as beneficial for the environment   3 
104,42, Adding major unrelated components to use up undisbursed loan balances should be done with the same rigor as   the appraisal of a stand alone project  to maximize the chances for successful implementation  
105,42,4   Voluntary environmental performance management agreements can be a powerful tool for a new environmental   agency 
106,43, 11 
107,43,Comments on Quality of ICR   The ICR is succinct and covers the main descriptive elements and issues reasonably well  although it could have   been enhanced with a number of tables clearly setting out comparisons of appraisal  revised and actual   achievements  with respect to  project description  performance indicators  cost estimates  financing plans  economic   and financial rates of return etc  
109,44,However  a major issue regarding ICR quality is that the hazardous waste component is only sketchily described and   no information is given on its justification or the process by which it entered the project  
110,44, The reasons why  after three  years  it had only reached the bidding documents stage  are not clearly presented    Its outcome should not have  been rated S  given that nothing had been constructed  
111,44, Other ICR shortcomings are 
112,45,Section 4 5 on institutional development impact is too sketchy  Annex 2 does not contain the standard tables comparing actual and appraisal project costs and financing plans  
113,45,   Three different figures are given for total Bank disbursements  
114,45,The economic analysis is in a different form from that in the SAR and should be further reviewed for possible    double counting Annex 3 does not provide basic supporting information on assumptions and methodology  No financial analysis is attempted  M E systems are not mentioned or evaluated  There is no assessment of how safeguard issues were treated at appraisal  at the inclusion of the hazardous    waste component and during implementation
