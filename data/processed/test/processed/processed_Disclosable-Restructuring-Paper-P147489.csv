1,0, 7 B  Is the project being prepared in a Situation of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraints  as per Bank IPF  Policy  para  12  No  8 C 
2,0,Summary Description of Proposed Project   The project will put forth a new PA management model  comprising of the following key characteristics     Mobilize new sources of finance 
3,0,The project will leverage new sources of finance to support viable  biodiversity economy businesses to emerge among local communities in PA landscapes  also increasing the benefits  deriving from PAs 
4,0,It will achieve such goal by establishing and capitalizing a Biodiversity Economy Fund  BEF   dedicated to the above mentioned purposes 
5,0,The project will also consider leveraging existing initiatives created with   9 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   10 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  11 compatible objectives  such as the Green Outcome Fund  and the Tourism Conservation Fund  
6,0,The project will also  seek potential sources of financing domestically  including from Treasury  national  provincial and local government  departments and agencies  and targeted PAs agencies  budget  consequently contributing to redirect domestic  resources towards socio economic development outcomes 
7,0,   Catalyze public and private sector resources 
8,0,The project will forge strategic partnerships with key  stakeholders from governmental departments  to NGOs and the private sector  helping build the bridge between  currently unrealized but potentially viable business opportunities at the community household level and the private  sector  while also fostering the development of market driven  inclusive value chains around PAs landscapes 
9,0,The  project will set up a mechanism to unlock access to finance and markets for businesses in rural landscapes around  PAs  by establishing a Launchpad tool which will map private sector operators active in targeted PA landscapes  their  interest in making their value chain more sustainable by partnering with local communities  and their jobs and  services  needs  more details about the Launchpad will be found in Component 2  
10,0,Actors which the project will link  up to include  Tourism Conservation Fund  Airbnb   concessions holders in and around PAs  philanthropy  actors  within the game and fisheries industry  and impact investors 
11,0,   Increase benefits from PAs to local communities 
12,0,The project will put forth a mechanism to significantly  increase benefits to local communities  and consequently contribute to change their attitudes towards PAs and its  valuable biodiversity 
13,0,This mechanism will include   i  Support to biodiversity economy businesses  The project will increase benefits from PAs to communities by  setting up a system to help them develop business capacities  linkages with finance and markets  while also ensuring  these businesses are compatible with biodiversity conservation 
14,0,The types of businesses that the project will promote  are mainly the following  i  tourism  hospitality  marketing  tourism activities  services to the tourism industry  chefs   electricity technicians  etc    ii  game ranching  animal husbandry  veterinary services  game processing  etc   iii  forest  products  commercial forestry  veld and non timber forest products  iv  agriculture  agronomy  post harvest  management  processing and commercialization  v  business services  IT  consulting  services  software development  and programming    vi  financial services  including insurance brokers  accounting and tax consultant firms   and  advertising  communications and marketing  vii  economic activities mostly relevant for women   ii  Establishment and delivery of PES to reward positive behaviors towards the environment  PES aim to  stimulate behavior compatible with conservation goals  such as sustainable land management practices and reduced  poaching through cash payments normally at the household level  but sometimes also at community level  against  measured performance 
15,0,The project will pilot such a mechanism to reward the adoption of sustainable land and  wildlife uses   iii  More inclusive PA management 
16,0,By supporting multi stakeholders  multi sectoral forums and governance  mechanisms for enhanced coordination and efficiency in achieving sustainability outcomes  the project will also  ensure that management of PAs  including land use planning decisions  will include a more active participation of local  communities living in the targeted PA landscapes 
17,0,  12 D  Environmental and Social Overview D 1 
18,0,Project location s  and salient characteristics relevant to the ES assessment  The project will be implemented in the landscapes around iSimangaliso Wetland Park and Kruger National Park  KNP  
19,0, These two PA have the potential to rapidly scale up ongoing activities and demonstrate the application of the  proposed  hubs  of rural development model 
20,0,The choice of iSimangaliso Wetland Park  in addition  will enable to   13 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   14 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  15 build on results and lessons learned from a recently closed World Bank project  that focused on protecting the  exceptional biodiversity of the Park though conservation  sustainable resources use  rational land use planning  and  local economic development 
21,0,The choice of KNP  part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area  will  allow to leverage its ground breaking achievements in terms of biodiversity conservation  environmental education   sustainable tourism and local development promotion  and it will also allow for positive externalities deriving from  strengthened transfrontier cooperation 
22,0,SANParks is currently identifying a third PA landscape  following a robust  selection process 
23,0,  16 KNP is the largest protected area in South Africa and comprises almost 20 000 km2 in the provinces of Limpopo and  Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa 
24,0,The KNP is a world renowned tourism destination with approximately 1 6  million visitors annually  SANParks  2014  
25,0,Despite the conservation successes of KNP  the early establishment of the  Park involved forced removals of people from within the KNP boundaries  supported by policies that restricted access  to certain sectors of society  Carruthers  1995  
26,0,This was at a time when the South African apartheid government was  moving thousands of people into culturally homogenous   Bantustan  homeland areas  some of which bordered the  KNP 
27,0,Currently  approximately 2 million people reside in the 7 South African municipalities bordering KNP  many of  whom rely on subsistence agriculture and social grants due to high regional unemployment rates  municipal level  unemployment rates range from 28 1  to 52 1    Stats SA  2015  
28,0,The area is typified by low agricultural potential   Lahiff and Cousins  2009  and employment within KNP is very sought after 
29,0,The 1073 km of KNP periphery abuts  private and government conservation land  rural and urban towns and villages  agriculture and industry   the diversity  of which would be hard to meet anywhere else in the world 
30,0,  17 The iSimangaliso Wetland Park is located in KwaZulu Natal  one of the three poorest provinces in South Africa 
31,0,It falls  within the uMkhanyakude District Municipality  ranked as one of the poorest and most deprived municipality in the  country 
32,0,According to the 2011 national census  the surrounding districts have a population of 676 810 
33,0,Over 80  of  households live below the poverty line and an estimated 13  of the economically active population is formally  employed 
34,0,Of the population s citizens who are 20 years and older  25 4  have grade 12 and 4 9  have higher  education  The unemployment rate is 42 8  and HIV prevalence is between 13 and 15  
35,0,Gender based violence   GBV  is equally widespreadHigh dependency ratios  HIV AIDS prevalence  numbers of orphaned children   unemployment and social grant dependency make for highly vulnerable communities 
36,0,The social impacts of migration  remain strong   many households are female headed or headed by orphaned children 
37,0,In this context  many  households rely extensively on natural resources from iSimangaliso for survival  for example  harvesting of reeds and  fruit  agriculture and fishing 
38,0,The depletion and degradation of natural resources in communal areas has meant that  there is increasing pressure on the resources inside the Park 
39,0, This trade off between short and long term livelihood  strategies stems from the conditions of poverty that characterize the lives of 80  of the people living in the area 
40,0,The  need to deliver tangible benefits to local communities is  thus  not only an economic imperative but also conservation  imperative    18 D  2 
41,0,Borrower s Institutional Capacity A Project Implementation Unit  PIU  will be established comprising of staff from SANParks  iSimangaliso Wetland  Authority  and The South African National Biodiversity Institute  SANBI  tasked with the responsibility for financial  management  procurement and environmental and social management  monitoring and supervision 
42,0,The PIU will be  domiciled in DEFF for the sole purpose of coordinating the project implementation and overseen by a multi  stakeholder project steering committee  with participation of the Department of Environment  Forestry and Fisheries   former DEA   local governments  project partners  civil society  and private sector representatives This PIU has   19 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   20 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  21 appointed a gender and social inclusion specialist and a stakeholder engagement specialist as part of the safeguard  team 
43,0,The environmental specialist identification is being finalized  This team will lead the preparation and  implementation of the ESA instruments 
44,0,They will be in turn supported by the PIUs at SANPark  SANBI and  Isimangaliso for the actual investment implementation 
45,0,  22 South African National Parks  SANParks    a public entity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Environmental  Affairs   is the leading conservation authority in all national parks in South Africa 
46,0,It manages a system of 19 national  parks in seven of the nine provinces of South Africa with a total area of just over 4 million hectares comprising 67  of  the protected areas under state management 
47,0,The SANParks is recognised as a world leader in conservation and  protected area management 
48,0,Conservation  responsible tourism and socio economic development are the three core  pillars of its operations 
49,0,In relation to the last pillar  SANParks has expanded its role in the developmental support  provided to neighbouring communities as an entity of the developmental state 
50,0,SANParks is implementing a number  of social programmes promoting access and benefit sharing  socio economic development and improved living  conditions for local communities living around the national parks 
51,0,The institution has shown significant capacity in  managing the environmental and social impacts of its activities to meet requirements of national law and good  practice 
52,0,However  SANParks has never implemented a WB project and requires training in the application of the new  Environmental and Social Framework  ESF  
53,0, 23 The iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority has strong capacity for addressing environmental and social risks and  impacts of projects consistent with the South Africa National Environmental Management Act 
54,0,This includes  implementation capacity  a proven track record for high quality environment work at both the strategic and project  specific level  and enforcement at the Park level 
55,0,The national environmental regulatory framework applicable to the  iSimangaliso Wetland Park is sound  well designed and adequately enforced 
56,0,The iSimangaliso Authority is subject to  institutional oversight and monitoring by the South Africa s Department of Environment  Forestry and Fisheries 
57,0, However  with the launching of the new Environmental and Social Framework  ESF  on 1 October 2018  the  iSimangaliso Authority will need to be trained on the new ESF to meet the requirements under each Environmental  and Social Standard 
58,0,  24 SANBI is a public institution established in September 2004 in terms of the National Environmental Management   Biodiversity Act  Act No 10 of 2004  
59,0,The mandate of SANBI is to play a leading role in South Africa s national  commitment to biodiversity management  and it is tasked to lead the country s biodiversity research agenda  in  partnership with the Department of Environment  Forestry and Fisheries 
60,0,SANBI also contributes to the key  government priority of eradicating poverty through by creating sustainable employment opportunities 
61,0, 25 An Institutional Capacity Assessment will be undertaken as part of the ESMF and a Strengthening Plan  will be  developed to strengthen any identified capacity gaps    26 II 
62,0,SCREENING OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL  ES  RISKS AND IMPACTS  27 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   28 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  29 The Environmental Risk Classification of the Project is Moderate under the World Bank s ESF 
63,0,The proposed project is  expected to generate significant environmental benefits resulting from the Project s focus on restoration and  conservation of terrestrial and aquatic ecological processes and management of both the iSimangaliso Wetland Park  and the Kruger National Park as well as support for a number of local development initiatives in creating employment  and generating livelihoods for local communities living within the protected areas 
64,0,No significant or irreversible  environmental risks and impacts are anticipated 
65,0,Some temporary  localized  adverse environmental impacts of minor  to moderate scale are anticipated partly during the construction phase including dust  noise  management and  disposal of debris and other construction related waste 
66,0,However  these environmental risks and impacts will be site  specific  temporary  and irreversible by applying good construction practices to be included in the ESMF   covering  environmental screening  chance find procedures  OHS  and developing site specific ESMPs for individual contractors  to manage the civil works 
67,0,  30 The Social Risk Rating is considered to be moderate at this stage as the Project does not involve activities with a  potential to harm the population taking into account the nature and magnitude of the potential social risks and  impacts of the proposed activities 
68,0,The potential adverse impacts on local communities will be limited  site specific  and few and can be managed with the application of appropriate mitigation measures 
69,0,Key social concerns are related  to  1  labor and working conditions of those engaged in the sub project minor construction works and those directly  engaged by the project to provide technical services   2  community health and safety related to the minor  construction works  and  3   potential land access restrictions  and  4  the need to consider the potential escalation of  conflicts among stakeholders due to the participatory planning activities as well as the potential risk of GBV in  particular Sexual Exploitation and Abuse  SEA  
70,0,The activities to be financed by the project will include participatory  planning and collaborative multi stakeholder platforms  capacity building and skills development and the promotion  of inclusive value chains and businesses 
71,0,The project needs to pay attention to the participatory planning activities  that could lead to conflicts among stakeholders and potentially risks of gender based violence 
72,0,To address this  potential risk  the project will support the preparation of a shared  integrated landscape management vision  based  on existing planning instruments and on discussions with local stakeholders  including local government  private  sector  local communities  civil society organizations 
73,0,A Stakeholder Engagement Plan applying a conflict management  approach along with a Grievance Mechanism  will also be prepared to help in preventing and solving potential  community conflicts 
74,0, A GBV assessment tool and other relevant assessment tools will be used to identify potential  GBV risks and mitigation measures to address the identified risks  such measures will be included in the detailed  ESMPs 
75,0,The proposed project is expected to have a positive socio economic impact because it seeks to improve the  skills of the local communities and increase the number of conservation compatible businesses and associated  income and jobs to local communities 
76,0,Due to its participatory approach  the project is not expected to bring any  adverse effects for beneficiary communities 
77,0,Instead  it will support only activities that will contribute to improve the  livelihood of local communities  increase their social resilience  adaptive and mitigating capacity to deal with the  social and environmental pressures that they face as well as strengthen the capacity of their representative  institutions to plan and to promote the effective  efficient and sustainable management of their lands and natural  resources 
78,0, 31 B 
79,0,Environment and Social Standards  ESSs  that Apply to the Activities Being Considered  32 ESS1 Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts  33 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   34 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  35 The first two components of the project   promoting integrated landscape management and strengthening the  enabling environment for promoting conservation compatible rural development around targeted protected areas  landscapes   will support studies  document review  training  coaching  mentoring  South South exchanges  capacity  building  technical assistance  TA  and sensitization campaigns  which are not anticipated to result in direct or indirect  environmental and social risks and impacts 
80,0,Therefore  as a result of the screening no further environmental and  social assessment  ESA  is proposed for Components 1 and 2 
81,0,However  relevant requirements of the ESF will be  incorporated in the TOR for the TA activity to ensure that any potential E S risks related to implementation of the TA  or TA outputs is consistent with ESF requirements 
82,0,  36 ESA requirements of ESS1 are considered relevant for subprojects under Component 3  which will be implemented  through a matching grant scheme 
83,0,General types of possible impacts relate to labor conditions  occupational health  and safety  community health and safety  gender based violence in particular sexual exploitation and abuse   exclusion of disadvantaged groups and pollution prevention 
84,0,Potential impacts of attracting more people to sensitive  areas through support for economic activities will equally be assessed as part of the ESMF and proportionate  mitigation measures will be identified 
85,0,Because the specific subprojects have not yet been identified  the Client will  prepare an Environmental and Social Management Framework  ESMF  to set out the principles  rules  guidelines and  procedures to assess the environmental and social risks and impacts and guide the screening for environmental and  social risks and impacts of sub projects under the matching grant component  including identifying the appropriate  ESA instruments  mitigation and monitoring measures to manage the environmental and social risks and impacts   including roles and responsibilities  schedule  costs and implementation procedures 
86,0,The draft ESMF will be disclosed  in country and on the Bank s external website prior to appraisal 
87,0,Value chain and businesses subprojects will be  subject to screening against eligibility criteria  including environmental and social risk screening 
88,0,A list of non eligible  value chains and businesses will be developed to include subprojects which might likely generate high and or  substantial environmental and social risks and impacts 
89,0,The ESMF will also include   a generic Environmental and  Social Management Plan  ESMP  with guidelines for general mitigation and monitoring measures for value chains and  businesses  sub projects that will be identified during project implementations  roles and responsibilities  time plans   costs and implementation agencies for each mitigation measure recommended 
90,0,This generic ESMP will then be  adaptable for specific value chains and businesses as they become identified during project implementation 
91,0, Entrepreneurs accessing the Matching Grant Scheme  MGS  will be required  as a condition of their contracts with  the project  to implement and comply with the ESMP 
92,0, 37 Areas where  Use of Borrower Framework  is being considered  The Borrower s E S framework will not be applied 
93,0, 38 The Implementing Agency will conduct stakeholder mapping  analysis and prepare a Stakeholder Engagement Plan   SEP  
94,0,A draft of the SEP will be prepared and disclosed as early as possible and prior to Appraisal 
95,0,The Borrower will  seek stakeholder feedback and opportunities for proposed future engagement  ensuring that all consultations are  inclusive and accessible  both in format and location  and through channels that are suitable in the local context 
96,0,The   39 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   40 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  41 Borrower will provide stakeholders with timely  relevant  understandable and accessible information  and consult  with them in a culturally appropriate manner  which is free of manipulation  interference  coercion  discrimination  and intimidation 
97,0,If major changes are made to the SEP  a revised SEP should be publicly disclosed 
98,0,The Borrower will  engage in meaningful consultations with all stakeholders throughout the project life cycle  paying attention to the  inclusion of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups  including the elderly  persons with disabilities  female headed  households and orphans and vulnerable children  
99,0,Directly affected stakeholders are likely to include  i  community  members  in particular individual entrepreneurs  small  medium and micro sized enterprises  SMMEs   community  based organizations  CBOs   such as co operatives  who will receive training and or grants under the project   ii   private sector firms that may establish partnerships with entrepreneurs in local communities  and  iii  service  providers and NGOs providing technical assistance and training   iv  Community level governance structures  CPAs or  community trusts  that will benefit through strengthening of capacity for negotiation of land tenure security and co  management of natural resources 
100,0,Other interested parties are likely to include the Department of Environmental  Affairs  provincial and municipal authorities  communities living in the selected landscapes  and the general public 
101,0,A  comprehensive grievance and redress mechanism  GRM  will be designed  developed and maintained by the  implementing agencies 
102,0,The GRM will enable stakeholders to channel concerns  questions  and complaints from  communities and other stakeholders and respond to issues related to a broad range of project implementation  issues 
103,0, 42 The Implementing Agency will consult upon and disclose the ESMF in line with the requirements of the ESF  The ESMF  will be disclosed in country and the Bank s external website prior to appraisal 
104,0, 43 A brief description of the potential environmental and social risks and impacts relevant to the Project 
105,0, 44 ESS2 is relevant to both the staff contracted to provide services directly under the project  training  planning   technical assistance etc   and to businesses and value chain subprojects to be supported with the Matching Grant  Scheme 
106,0,Matching Grant eligibility requirements will include the preparation of Labor Management Procedures  including key aspects of labor rights and occupational health and safety  and verification that all subproject workers  have been made aware of the provisions of these procedures 
107,0,The occupational health and safety  OHS  measures  will be in line with World Bank Group General Environment  Health and Safety  EHS  Guidelines 
108,0,Minor construction  activities are envisaged for the project  but these will be temporary  localized and with limited foot print and  therefore does not entail a significant amount of labor 
109,0,Any labor required for the implementation of the value chain  projects will be locally hired  with the exception of skilled workers who cannot be found in the protected areas  landscapes 
110,0,No labor camps are anticipated for any of the value chain projects and no influx of workforce is  anticipated based on the proposed project structure 
111,0,  45 This standard is relevant given that the project will finance development of sustainable businesses and value chains  including agricultural related activities such as post harvest management  processing and commercialization of   46 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   47 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  48 agricultural products and make use of agrochemicals 
112,0,The ESMF will include specific measures to minimize avoid the  potential negative impacts related to the use of agrochemicals including pesticides 
113,0,  49 The project is not expected to cause any adverse safety and health impacts on the communities since the project is  not funding any large scale civil works on the ground 
114,0, A preliminary GBV risk screening has been undertaken and the  risk has been classified as Low 
115,0,The value chain subprojects will not be large scale and therefore it is not expected  that there will be an influx of workers into the subprojects areas 
116,0,However  in the event that influx would occur the  ESMF and subsequent ESMPs will include mitigation measures for labor influx management 
117,0,In addition  there may be  minor community health and safety related impacts during the subprojects preparation  mitigation measures for such  potential impacts will be captured in the  corresponding ESMP 
118,0,Furthermore  potential risks of GBV SEA will be  considered in the ESMF and subsequent ESMPs and measures will be put in place to mitigate and manage any risks of  GBV SEA incidents 
119,0, 50 ESS5 Land Acquisition  Restrictions on Land Use and Involuntary Resettlement Involuntary resettlement is not expected to occur through the project activities as the project will support the  expansion of protected areas into community and private owned areas following the Biodiversity Stewardship model   which was recently developed and implemented in South Africa 
120,0,However  it is likely that restrictions on land use may  occur and as such a Process Framework has been recommended 
121,0,Based on available information  it is not expected  that these restrictions would potentially affect informal users  tenants and workers   nor displacing informal or illegal  activities to other nearby areas  however  this will be further assessed during the Bank s due diligence mission as well  as in the ESMF 
122,0,Potential impacts of attracting more people to sensitive areas through support for economic activities  will equally be assessed as part of the ESMF and proportionate mitigation measures will be identified 
123,0,  51 Biodiversity Stewardship is an approach to entering into agreements with private and communal landowners to  protect and manage land in biodiversity priority areas  led by conservation authorities 
124,0,Since Biodiversity Stewardship  is based on voluntary commitments from landowners with a range of different types of biodiversity stewardship  agreements regulated by the Protected Areas Act  it is unlikely that adverse impacts on private land  assets or  involuntary resettlement will occur 
125,0,The same applies to the businesses and value chain subprojects that will be  supported by the Matching Grant Scheme that do not envisage major civil works 
126,0,In the event that these subprojects  would require the relocation of community members  this will be on a voluntary basis as per the Biodiversity  Stewardship model and will require an assessment of potential adverse impacts 
127,0,In the event that new information is  available during appraisal indicating that there may be involuntary relocation or impacts on livelihoods  the necessary  ESA instruments will be required 
128,0,  52 The project is designed to generate positive environment benefits by promoting conservation compatible  development in local communities within the KNP and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and  in turn  strengthen long  term support for conservation of the PAs 
129,0, Therefore  adverse impacts to biodiversity are anticipated to be limited 
130,0, The ESMF will confirm the presence of threatened endangered species according to the IUCN Classification and of   53 The World Bank South Africa  Catalyzing Financing and Capacity for the Biodiversity Economy around Protected Areas  P170213   54 For Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use OnlyFor Official Use Only  55 the sensitivity of the project site for bird species including migratory birds 
131,0,The KNP hosts populations of several  species of IUCN Red List vulnerable  endangered and critically endangered mammals  including lion  Panthera leo  melanochaita   leopard  Panthera pardus   cheetah  Acinonyx jubatus jubatus   elephant  Loxodonta africana    hippopotamus  Hippopotamus amphibius   mountain reedbuck  Redunca fulvorufula   wild dog  Lycaon pictus   and  black rhinoceros  Diceros bicornis minor  
132,0,Due diligence carried out on the iSimangaliso Wetland Park indicate the  following potential threats to natural habitats from the documentation of the World Heritage Convention and the  current approach used by the Wetland Authority to address the threats    i  the plantation of alien invasive species  the reduced water for indigenous plant and animal species and caused the soil to become more alkaline  which  further promoted encroachment in sensitive ecosystems  and  ii  uncontrolled harvesting of Ncema  a salt marsh  rush  used in the construction of huts 
133,0,However  as part of its broader Community Based Natural Resource  Management program  the Wetlands Authority has regulated the annual harvest and cutting practices  to balance  communities  current needs with the longer term sustainability of the ncema resource 
134,0,At this stage of the project   no new information is showing displacement of economic activities to sensitive areas  and therefore  no adverse risks  and impacts are anticipated 
135,0,Should there be changes during project preparation  the Appraisal ESRS will include the  necessary changes  their associated environmental risks and impacts and the corresponding mitigation measures 
136,0, Potential impacts of attracting more people to sensitive areas through support for economic activities will equally be  assessed as part of the ESMF and proportionate mitigation measures will be identified 
137,0, 56 BBased on information currently available  this standard does not appear to be relevant to the project 
138,0,However  this  will be further verified during the preparation mission and as part of the social impact assessment included in the  ESMF and SEP 
139,0,  57 Based on information currently available  ESS8 does not appear to be relevant to the project  as the project is not  likely to have risks or impacts on cultural heritage 
140,0,However  should there be any construction contracts identified   Chance Find Procedures will apply and these will be included as part of the ESMF  which will require contractors to  stop construction in the event that cultural property sites are encountered during construction 
141,0,Possible impacts on  Cultural Heritage will be further assessed and the applicability of the ESS will be determined during the  environmental and social assessment described in ESS1
