23,13,Commitment Fee  0 50 percent on undisbursed Credit balances  beginning 60 days after signing  less any waiver
24,14,Disbursement  The proposed credit will be disbursed in a single tranche of US 37 5 million  Signing of the proposed Credit will not take place until all arrears have been cleared 
25,14,Release of the proposed Credit s proceeds will happen only after effectiveness 
26,15,Background and The proposed Post Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit Description   Post Conflict ERC  is an integral part of the Bank s Transitional
27,16,Support Strategy  TSS  considered by the Board on January 16  2001  to assist the Republic of Congo in the transition from war to sustainable peace  in the context of the Government s 2000  2002 Interim Post Conflict Program 
28,16,It is the first operation of the TSS that would support implementation of   i  key structural reforms  and  ii  improved governance and better transparency in the management of the country s natural wealth and public funds 
29,16,These reforms are needed to stabilize and bring about the economic rehabilitation that would pave the way for broad based poverty reduction  and a higher and sustained growth path in the years ahead  after three decades of centrally planned economic management and almost a decade of wars 
30,16,Proceeds of the proposed Credit would provide critical funds necessary to assist the Republic of Congo with foreign exchange cash immediately after arrears to the World Bank have been paid 
31,17,Rationale for IDA The Bank s involvement is justified by the need to   i  address involvement  the immediate post conflict needs of the country   ii  provide the
32,18,development leadership needed for the reengagement of the international community in a country in the delicate and troubled Central Africa region  and  iii  focus on the sustainable development and poverty reduction agenda of reforms envisaged under the TSS 
33,18,In addition  the ceasefire and complete cessation of hostilities since 1999  and the ongoing progress toward peace  provide the international community with a window of opportunity to  i  consolidate the home grown and self financed national reconciliation process   ii  support the country s economic recovery and stabilization  and  iii  pave the way for broad based poverty reduction and growth in the years ahead  after decades of inappropriate policies  poor governance  and repeated social conflicts 
34,18,The proposed credit will complement support provided by other donors including the IMF  the EU  AfDB  the UN system  and bilateral donors 
35,18,The Credit will be implemented in parallel with the Transparency and Governance Capacity Building project  which is aimed at providing technical assistance to increase transparency and improve governance in the use of petroleum and forestry resources  as well as management of public funds 
36,18,Without the cash flow provided by the proposed operation  the Republic of Congo would find it very difficult to clear its arrears to the Bank  and access to Bank financial and other support would not be restored 
37,19,Government Commitment  Since 1998  Government has shown commitment to macroeconomic and structural reforms 
38,19,This is illustrated by the Government s resolve to vigorously pursue reforms launched by the previous regime  e g   divestiture of all Government owned forestry companies  privatization program for all commercial banks and key public enterprises  and reform of business regulatory framework   despite the lack of formal programns with the Bank and IMF 
39,19,Commitment at the highest level of the country s leadership and the entire Government  as well as support from the civil society  has been reaffirmed on several occasions 
40,20,1 
41,20,This report seeks approval to extend a Post Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit  Post Conflict ERC  to the Republic of Congo  RoC   for SDR 30 0 million  the equivalent of US 37 5 million  on standard International Development Association  IDA  terms  with a maturity of 40 years 
42,20,The proposed Credit is an integral part of the Bank s Transitional Support Strategy  TSS  considered by the Board on January 16  2001  to assist Congo in the transition from war to peace 
43,20,The proposed Post Conflict ERC would provide urgently needed quick disbursing funds that are critical to support the Government of Congo s 2000 2002 Interim Post  Conflict Program 
44,20,Specifically  the proposed Post Conflict ERC would   a  support the Government s effort to pursue and deepen structural reforms launched by the previous regime  but interrupted by the resurgence of war at the end of 1998  with special attention given to the banking sector deeply affected by the events  and  b  build the foundations for increased transparency  improved governance  and accountability in public resources management 
45,21,2 
46,21,Actions envisaged under the proposed Credit would help the economy s rehabilitation and result in higher and sustained growth in non oil real GDP  estimated to recover to 5 8 percent in 2001 and 6 1 percent in 2002 
47,21,This estimated growth performance would come from sustained macroeconomic stability  higher private investments  lower cost of doing business  and a broader revenue base for financing larger and more effective public expenditures programs 
48,21,Consolidating progress toward a sustainable peace  and the improved delivery of essential services  would also help reduce the poverty incidence  while greater dynamism of a revitalized private sector would help expand income earning opportunities for the poor 
49,21,Proceeds of the proposed Credit would provide critical funds necessary to assist the Republic of Congo with the foreign exchange cash flow immediately after the arrears to the World Bank have been paid 
50,22,3  Since independence in 1960  Congo  Brazzaville  has had a troubled history characterized by ethnic strife  civil war  institutional instability  and poor governance 
51,22,Ruined by three decades of poor management under a centrally planned economy and Marxist inspired single party rule  and nearly a decade of violent conflict  the Republic of Congo has experienced economic
52,23,performance well below its potential 
53,23,Social and economic conditions deteriorated sharply under the centrally planned economy  with real GNP per capita falling by more than half  from US 1300 in 1982 to US 630 in 2000 
54,23,Social and poverty indicators worsened in the last decade  as the country has been torn by political instability and a series of civil wars  1993 94  1997  and 1998 99  
55,23,Despite increased production and higher prices in the oil sector in the period 1997 99  real GDP was stagnant in the same period 
56,23,Because virtually all oil production is offshore and represented  on average  more than 60 percent of GDP in the 1997 99 period  real GDP stagnation in the same period reflects the sharp contraction   19 percent  in the non oil sector  as a result of the conflict inflicted damage to domestic productive capacity 
57,24,4 
58,24,While external developments were a factor underlying the poor economic performance observed over the last 40 years  the more fundamental reasons for this poor performance were inappropriate policies  weak economic management  poor governance  and civil war 
59,24,All conflicts in the last decade involved human suffering on a large scale 
60,24,In addition  the Republic of Congo  Brazzaville  has been confronted with unrest at its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo  DRC   and a sizable number of refugees  more than 100 000 people  has put additional strain on the country s limited resources 
61,25,5 
62,25,In the last year  with the signing of ceasefire and end of hostilities agreements with key military commanders of the defeated opposition  the security situation has improved dramatically in Brazzaville and throughout the country 
63,25,The challenge is now for the present regime to make the dual transitions from civil war to sustainable peace  and from a state controlled economy to one that is market based 
64,25,So far  in an effort to alleviate the plight of the poor and meet the most urgent social and rehabilitation needs  Congolese authorities have focused their efforts on humanitarian assistance and implementation of the peace process 
65,25,These efforts culminated on April 14  2001 in a national dialogue on a new constitution and a convention for peace  and national reconciliation of Congolese from all ethnic backgrounds and all political sensitivities 
66,25,With the return to normalcy  Congolese authorities are progressively shifting their focus toward reconstruction and rehabilitation  along with reduction of internal and external macroeconomic imbalances 
67,25,Among the priorities are  tackling unemployment  re launching productive activities  and establishing a business friendly regulatory framework to promote private sector development 
68,26,6 
69,26,Whereas the wars of 1993 94 and 1997 were essentially limited to Brazzaville  the war of 1998 99 brought large scale destruction to southern Congo  except the area around Pointe  Noire   with dramatic social and humanitarian cost  widespread economic disruption  and weakened institutional and human capacities 
70,27,7  Social and Humanitarian Impact 
71,27,The 1998 99 war created an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe  with 300 000 residents of Brazzaville fleeing the city and seeking refuge in the forests  where they lived in appalling conditions for up to one year 
72,27,At the height of the 1998 1999 conflict  some 810 000 people  or almost a third of the population  were displaced  of which 30 000 sought refuge in Gabon or the Democratic Republic of Congo  DRC  
73,27,Seventy percent of those internally displaced were malnourished  Many people lost all their belongings
74,28,and suffered great physical and psychological hardship  The country was pillaged on both sides of the front line 
75,28,Iron sheets were stolen from houses and churches  fields were burned  and health centers and other public buildings were looted 
76,28,With the return of most displaced persons to their original residences  needs have shifted away from emergency humanitarian interventions toward social reintegration  infrastructure rehabilitation  and reconstruction 
77,29,8  Economic Impact  The preliminary estimate of damage inflicted by the last two civil wars is CFAF 1600 billion  about US 2 6 billion   well exceeding the size of the 1999 GDP 
78,29,Non oil GDP  a better indicator to assess the impact of the war on domestic productive capacity  as oil is produced essentially offshore   declined by 19 percent between 1996 and 1999 
79,29,By the time of the outbreak of the 1997 civil war  Congo s economy had already been weakened by years of poor economic management and governance  as well as the bloody 1993 94 conflict and social unrest 
80,29,Most of the country s basic infrastructure has been destroyed or is in a state of collapse due to lack of maintenance 
81,29,It is estimated that 50 percent of agricultural tools were destroyed and 75 percent of livestock lost  Many archives were destroyed or looted 
82,29,The distribution network  already weak before the war  collapsed  and most feeder roads are impassable 
83,29,Basic public services  including telecommunications  water and electricity services  road and rail transportation were severely disrupted 
84,29,The railway line between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville  the economic umbilical cord of the country  was destroyed at several points 
85,29,The war has also taken its toll on schools and health care facilities 
86,30,9  The rehabilitation needs of the country  including in basic infrastructure  railway  roads  electricity  water  and telecommunications   are immense 
87,30,Individual needs include the reconstruction of houses and the provision of means of production lost during the war  including tools  seeds  and livestock 
88,30,Private business has also been severely affected by the upheavals caused by the unstable security situation in the country 
89,30,The banking sector was strongly affected and the commercial banks came out of the events insolvent and illiquid 
90,30,Most bank deposits were de facto frozen and the banks had no resources to contribute to the regeneration of economic activity 
91,30,For communities  the needs include the rehabilitation of every form of economic and social infrastructure  as well as the resources for the proper functioning of this infrastructure 
92,30,To date  the Government has rehabilitated the railway line  and donors  UN agencies  and NGOs have initiated limited rehabilitation activities 
93,31,10  Institutional and Capacity Impact  The civil unrest and insecurity created by the repetitive conflict have significantly weakened Congo s institutional and human capacities 
94,31,The disruption of the country s administrative capacity has been severe  with losses of manpower  records  and IT equipment for most institutions 
95,31,Most public offices and buildings were burned down  destroyed  vandalized  or pillaged in 8 of the country s 11 regions 
96,31,There was a heavy loss of vehicles belonging to the Government  private and public institutions  and civilian populations 
97,31,Many professionals in key areas left the country  leaving a vacuum in critical areas of service delivery 
98,32,11  Following the 1998 99 war  and in order to create the social conditions that would allow the population to fully participate in the normalization of political life and economic
99,33,reconstruction  the Government in early 2000 prepared a Medium Term Interim Post Conflict Program  PIPC  for the 2000 2002 period 
100,33,The PIPC aims to address immediate post conflict needs  revitalize the economy  and build the foundation for sustainable economic and social development under a market based economy 
101,33,The IMF endorsed the Government s program  on November 17  2000  under the IMF s Emergency Post Conflict Assistance Program 
102,34,12 
103,34,The Government s PIPC is centered around four main objectives   a  pursuing structural reforms through privatization cum restructuring of the country s three commercial banks  privatization of the five largest public enterprises  and improved regulatory framework for private sector business   b  laying the foundation for better governance and increased transparency in management of the country s natural wealth  oil and forestry  and public funds   c  rebuilding and strengthening the country s administrative and institutional capacity  to enable growth in the non oil sector to resume  and  d  improving the macroeconomic framework and the social climate to create job opportunities  enhance production capacity  and promote growth 
104,35,13 
105,35,To lay the foundation for higher and sustainable growth in the years ahead  under a market based economy  Congolese authorities aim to increase the private investment response and allow efficient business operations in Congo 
106,35,To this end  they will pursue privatization cum restructuring of all three commercial banks and key public utilities  water  electricity  telecommunications  railway  oil products distribution   rationalization of the business regulatory framework  and improved business incentives 
107,35,The overall aims of the program are to remove the major policy related and institutional impediments to private sector development in a coherent and transparent manner 
108,36,14  Actions Already Taken  The Government has already privatized all forestry companies and some consumer good producing companies  mill company  animal food and livestock equipment company  
109,36,In addition  the Government recently finalized privatization of downstream activities in the oil petroleum sector with the dismantling of the former national oil company  Hydrocongo  and the takeover of downstream oil distribution by foreign private oil companies  TotalFina and Shell  
110,36,Preparatory work for privatization in other sectors  including water  electricity  telecommunications  railroad  and hotels  is well advanced 
111,36,Special attention is being given to restructuring the banking sector  a prerequisite for the restoration of a working payment system  macroeconomic stability  and private sector development 
112,36,A commercial bank  the Union Congolaise des Banques  UCB   has already been taken over by a foreign private investor  and its restructuring finalized with the split of the bank into a healthy unit taken by the foreign private investor  and a liquidation structure transferred to a Government s agency  the Caisse Congolaise d Amortissement  CCA 
113,36,With Bank assistance  Government has also drafted new regulatory frameworks for private sector investments in key areas  water and electricity code  telecommunication code  and forestry code  
114,36,An investment chart  in harmony with regionally agreed CEMAC provisions  has also been finalized with Bank assistance  and a one  stop investment window established 
115,36,and implementation of regulations to enhance loan recovery by the CCA   The proposed Credit also aims at achieving significant progress toward privatization of key public utilities 
116,36,In this context the bidding process for the concession or leasing of water and electricity companies has been prepared and a notice sent for advertisement in local and
117,37,international newspapers  while the notice of request for expression of interest for the private concession of the Congo Ocean railway  CFCO  has also been sent for advertisement in local and international newspapers 
118,38,15  Actions To Be Taken  In the context of its Medium Term Program  the Government aims at deepening the ongoing privatization and liberalization process through the following actions 
119,39,  Completing privatization of the two other commercial banks  Caisse pour l  Agriculture et l Industrie et le Commerce  CAIC  and the Banque pour l Industrie et le Developpement du Congo  BIDC   with the signing of protocol agreements with potential foreign private partners who have expressed their preparedness to participate in the newly restructured and privatized banks  November 2001  
120,40,  Strengthening the regulatory framework in key markets by publishing selected implementation decrees of the newly approved forest code  adopting the post and telecommunications code  the water code  and the electricity codes  and enacting their implementation decrees  and reviewing the regulatory framework for port authority services  September 2001  
121,41,  Removing policy related impediments to private sector investments and efficient business operations by finalizing price liberalization and elimination of remaining monopolies  enacting the regional investment code and its implementation decree  effectively implementing a one stop investment window  and setting up a commission for review of the labor code  September 2001  
122,42,16 
123,42,Recognizing the importance of good governance and increased transparency in the promotion of democracy  improvement of the Government s overall budget performance  and effectiveness in the delivery of public services  the Government s program aims at laying the foundation for increased transparency and better management of the country s wealth  oil and forestry  and public funds 
124,43,17  Actions Already Taken 
125,43,The Government has already upgraded the budget expenditure control and monitoring system and is now adhering strictly to the principle of consolidated cash management at the Treasury 
126,43,With the approval of the organic budget law by the National Transition Council in early 2000  the principle of consolidation of cash management at the Treasury has been reinforced  and at the moment only the budget directorate can financially commit the Government 
127,43,Because oil revenue  the most dominant source of Government revenue  78 percent of total revenue in 2000   has been managed with relative opacity  the proposed Credit aims at clarifying the financial relationships between the state and the national oil management company  the Societe Nationale des Hydrocarbures du Congo  SNPC  
128,43,This substantial improvement in the transparency of oil revenue management in Congo  a major departure from past opaque practices  has been done with the signing on June 29  2001  of a framework agreement clarifying the relationship between SNPC and the state represented by the
129,44,Minister of Finance and Budget and the Minister of Oil Industry 
130,44,The new framework provides for transparency in all SNPC transactions  regular publication of actual revenues collected from all sources  revenue forecasts  revenues transferred to the Government  publication of all transactions and trade practices  regular audits  and publication of SNPC financial statements 
131,45,18  Action To Be Taken  As part of its Medium Term Reform Program  the Government also aims at completing the following actions in the coming months 
132,46,  Launch of the first audit the national oil company  SNPC   and subsequent implementation of regular audits 
133,47,  Review of public markets procurement rules and practice  and definition of directions for reform 
134,48,  Institutionalization of the Auditor General  Cour des comptes   and implementation decree 
135,49,  Launch of the first audits of public funds management for a few institutions by the Auditor General 
136,50,  Assessment of the status of all logging permits  and design of a strategy and schedule for new allocations and revisions of current permits 
137,51,  Assessment of forestry tax collection for the current fiscal year  with indication of pursuits  backlog penalties  and exoneration  with tables by type of taxes collected  company  and permit  as well as projection for next fiscal year 
138,52,  Mapping of existing and proposed national protected areas network  with phasing of all steps leading to final protected area status 
139,53,19 
140,53,Given the severe disruption of the country s administrative and institutional capacity  following the two most recent conflicts  a major priority of the Government s Medium Term Program is the restoration of coordination within the public sector 
141,53,Policy formulation and coordination were enhanced with the creation of an inter ministerial committee charged with the coordination and implementation of economic policy  as well as the coordination of all ministries involved 
142,53,The accompanying Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project will support and provide technical assistance needed to implement actions envisaged under the proposed Credit  with priority given to Government agencies involved in economic and finance management  and efficient management of oil wealth and forestry resources 
143,54,20  During the conflicts  fiscal management became disrupted as established budgetary procedures were abandoned and spending priorities shifted toward security and humanitarian
144,55,assistance  Without access to domestic or external financing  budget deficits were financed largely through accumulation of arrears 
145,55,Fiscal deficits spilled over into the balance of payments  increasing the stock of external debt arrears to about 94 percent of GDP by end 1999 
146,55,The IMF s ongoing Post Conflict Emergency Assistance Program seeks to support the Government s effort to redress public finance imbalances through more effective expenditure management and improved revenue collection 
147,55,IMF support will be complemented by the Public Expenditure Review  PER  envisaged under the Bank s Transition Support Strategy 
148,55,In addition  the accompanying Transparency and Governance Capacity Building project will support and provide technical assistance needed for better expenditure management and improved revenue collection 
149,56,21  Satisfactory completion of structural  governance  and transparency reform measures  as agreed with IDA  would be triggers for coming IDA adjustment operations 
150,56,Successful implementation of the proposed Post Conflict ERC as well as the ongoing IMF Post Conflict Program would help eliminate remaining barriers and institutional impediments to private sector led growth  and pave the way for the formulation  under the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper  PRSP   of a medium term program aimed at achieving rapid  sustainable economic growth and further reducing poverty 
151,56,Such a program would allow Congo to benefit from substantial external debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC initiative  which is critical for alleviating the present heavy debt burden that seriously hampers its economic and social development 
152,57,22 
153,57,In light of the return to normalcy since the end of hostilities at the end of 1999  and given the worsening poverty situation  Congo s donor partners have shown strong support to the Government in its rehabilitation  recovery  peace  and national reconciliation process 
154,57,In this context  the Bank led a multi donor assessment mission in March April 2000 to organize the reengagement of the international community into Congo 
155,57,The mission included multilateral institutions  AfDB  EU  UNDP  OCHA  UNICEF  FAO  ILO  UNHCR  WHO  and bilateral donors  France  United States  and Italy  
156,57,The Bank also chaired a donors  meeting in Paris in early October 2000 in support of the Government s Interim Post Conflict Program and the IMF s Post Conflict Emergency Assistance Program 
157,57,Donor support at the Paris meeting was well beyond original expectations 
158,58,23  Donor coordination was also strengthened at an international humanitarian donors meeting and UN Consolidated Appeal  UN CAP   organized in Geneva in July 2000 by UNDP and the UN OCHA 
159,58,Although support for the UN CAP was mixed  the UN CAP process was important for its symbolism  and for putting Congo back on the world map after years of quasi isolation 
160,58,France  the United States  and Italy are actively involved in diverse social and humanitarian activities in the field 
161,58,Eleven UN agencies are present on the ground and active in various areas  e g   revival of productive activities  emergency needs  reestablishment of basic social services and infrastructure  promotion of democracy and human rights  
162,58,The EU and AfDB are presently finalizing preparation of their post conflict strategies 
163,58,The IMF Emergency Post  Conflict program was approved on November 17  2000  and the Bank Transitional Support Strategy for Congo considered by the Board on January 16  2001 
164,59,24 
165,59,The proposed Post Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit is an integral part of the Bank s Transitional Support Strategy  TSS  to assist the Republic of Congo in the transition from war to sustainable peace 
166,59,The TSS spans a 24 month period in support of the Govemment s 2000 2002 Interim Post Conflict program  in areas where the Bank has a clear comparative advantage 
167,59,The proposed Credit is the first operation of the TSS that would support implementation of   a  key structural reforms  and  b  improved governance and better transparency in the management of the country s natural wealth and public funds 
168,59,These reforms are needed to stabilize and bring about the economic rehabilitation that would pave the way for broad based poverty reduction  and higher and sustained growth path in the years ahead  after three decades of centrally planned economic management and almost a decade of wars 
169,60,25 
170,60,Other operations under the TSS include   a  an Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project  EDRP  to help demobilize and subsequently reintegrate about 10 000 ex  combatants into civil civilian life   b  a Transparency and Govemance Capacity Building Project to accompany reforms envisaged under the proposed Post Conflict ERC   c  an Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement of Living Conditions project to address unemployment issues through labor intensive micro projects  and  d  an AIDS HIV project to address the growing threat of AIDS 
171,61,26  Overview 
172,61,A middle income country during the 1980s  the Republic of Congo has seen a marked decline in living standards over the past decade  with Congo s GNP per capita decreasing by more than 50 percent from 1982 to 2000 
173,61,The decline in per capita income  and corresponding increase in poverty incidence  more than 70 percent of Congolese live below the international poverty line of US 1 day   is troubling given the country s vast natural resource endowments  rich oil and forestry resources  fertile land with plentiful rain  
174,61,One of the largest oil producers in sub Saharan Africa  Congo has failed to effectively use these resources to build the basic infrastructure of the country and improve the living standards of its people 
175,61,Characterized by ill  advised borrowing and misguided economic policies  state intervention in almost all industries and services  widespread price controls  inadequate investment incentives  poor labor legislation  distorted trade policies  large and inefficient public enterprises   Congo has experienced economic performance well below its potential during the first three post independence decades 
176,61,The three wars of the last decade have accelerated deterioration of Congo s poverty indicators and its social performance 
177,62,27  Health Situation  The health gains achieved through an extensive health care network built in the early decades following independence in 1960 have been lost in the past decade 
178,62,Infant vaccination rates for diseases such as measles have steadily dropped  to just 58 percent in 1999  from 99 4 percent 20 years ago 
179,62,Diseases such as tuberculoses have nearly quadrupled  from 32 per 100 000 in 1985 to 113 per 100 000 in 1999  Spread of HIV AIDS is another challenge for the country in coming years 
180,62,A recent study by the Ministry of Health showed that the 15 5 percent of pregnant women are infected with HIV AIDS in Pointe Noire  and 6 6 percent
181,63,in Brazzaville  Due to the deteriorating health system  coupled with AIDS and deaths from the wars  life expectancy has dropped to 48 6 years in 1999 from 53 years in 1993 
182,63,The health system suffers from a lack of facilities and financial assistance to tackle this challenge 
183,63,The Government spent only 1 2 percent of GDP for health in 1999  compared to 2 6 percent of GDP in early the 1990s 
184,63,In addition  the percentage of people with access to clean water and sanitary conditions has dropped over the same period  to 46 and 65 5 percent  respectively  in 1999 
185,64,28  Education  The primary school enrollment rate in the Congo was one of the highest in sub Saharan Africa in the mid 1980s 
186,64,However  gross primary school enrollment ratesi dropped from 125 2 percent in 1987 to 78 6 percent in 1998 
187,64,Similarly  gross secondary school enrollment rates have dropped from about 70 percent in the early 1980s to 35 7 percent in 1998 
188,64,As a result of these declining enrollment rates  literacy rates have also dropped to 59 5 percent  from about 65 percent in the mid 1980s 
189,64,In recent years  Government spending on education declined to 3 percent of GDP  compared with about 8 percent 20 years ago 
190,64,Lack of schoolteachers and crumbling infrastructure are some of the key problems facing the sector 
191,64,In addition to higher budgetary needs for social services  Government institutions and capacity have to be strengthened for better outcomes 
192,65,29  In 1997  real GDP declined by 2 4 percent  It rebounded by 3 7 percent in 1998  before declining again by 3 2 percent in 1999 
193,65,From 1982 to 2000  GNP per capita fell by more than half  and the number of people on the payrolls in both formal and informal sectors shrunk by about 35 percent  even though the population grew by about 30 percent during the same period 
194,65,Today  unemployment is widespread at more than 60 percent of the labor force 
195,65,With the successful implementation of the peace process following the ceasefire accord at the end of 1999  the economy rebounded in 2000 with a real GDP growth of 7 6 percent  higher than previously expected 
196,65,Due to relatively higher oil prices in 1999 and 2000  the overall fiscal balance moved from deficits   20 percent of GDP in 1998   6 2 percent in 1999  to surplus in 2000  1 2 percent of GDP   for the first time in several years 
197,65,The primary fiscal balance also improved  from a deficit of  6 3 percent of GDP in 1998  to a surplus of 5 6 percent in 1999  and 8 9 percent in 2000 
198,65,Despite these positive developments  a close look at Central Government operations shows that on the revenue side  non oil revenues did not improve much despite the recent surge in economic activity  and contributed only about 22 percent to total revenues  or 6 9 percent of GDP  in 2000 
199,65,Also on the expenditure side  and faced with huge humanitarian  security  and reconstruction needs  current expenditure including the wage bill and common expenses   a significant proportion of the total government budget   is continuing to increase despite the Government s commitment to curtail its growth 
200,65,Due to a record level of receipts from oil exports  the current account deficit improved significantly since 1999  decreasing from 26 7 percent of GDP in 1999 to 12 2 percent of GDP in 2000 
201,65,Thanks to higher export revenues  gross reserves soared from about US 45 million in 1999 to US 223 million in 2000 
202,66,Gross primary enrollment is the ratio of all primary students  regardless of age  to the number of primary school age children in the country 
203,67,30 
204,67,The government has also undertaken a number of emergency measures to revitalize the economy  including the heavy capital investment of Government s own resources in the post war construction effort and resumption of the train route between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville 
205,67,As a result of the implementation of such measures  productive activities have resumed  with significant impact on real GDP growth in 2000 without inflationary pressures 
206,67,Sectors such as manufacturing  commerce  transport  and communications expanded at double digit growth rates 
207,67,While the overall non oil GDP grew at an impressive 15 percent  oil GDP in real terms shrank slightly  by 1 percent 
208,67,Real private consumption grew at 21 percent in 2000  following a steady decline for more than a decade  Average inflation for 2000 was about 0 3 percent  due mainly to the decline of food prices 
209,68,31  The External Debt Situation  Congo is one of the most highly indebted countries in the world 
210,68,As of March 31  2001  the total outstanding external debt amounted to about US 5 4 billion  of which US 2 9 billion is made up of arrears 
211,68,Of this outstanding external debt  debt with Paris Club and other bilateral creditors represents 60 percent 
212,68,Commercial bank debt and multilateral debt represent  respectively  20 and 11 percent of the total outstanding external debt 
213,68,Collateralized debt on future oil revenue and debt to a few privileged creditors represent  respectively  5 and 3 percent of the outstanding external debt 
214,68,The total outstanding external debt to GDP ratio stands at about 200 percent in 2000  and the total debt to exports ratio is about 235 percent in 2000 
215,68,In March 31  2001  outstanding external debt per capita amounted to US 1 784  in contrast with a GNP per capita of only US 630 
216,69,32  World Bank Debt Arrears  As of May 15  2001  Congo s arrears to the World Bank totaled US  63 million  US 58 3 million to IBRD  and US 4 7 million to IDA  
217,69,Due to arrears on service payments to the Bank  Congo s withdrawal rights under Bank loans and IDA credits were suspended in 1997  and the country has been in non accrual status since then 
218,69,As agreed  the Government has cleared all arrears to IDA and currently carries US 34 million debt arrears to IBRD 
219,69,The clearance of the remaining US 34 million IBRD debt arrears before disbursement of the single tranche will be made possible by a bridge financing loan currently being negotiated between the Government of Congo and a third party 
220,69,Signing of the proposed Credit will not take place until all arrears have been cleared  Credit proceeds will be released only after Credit effectiveness 
221,69,The proposed IBRD debt arrears clearance approach is consistent with the IMF Post Conflict program  It will pave the way for the resumption of normal IDA lending to Congo 
222,70,33  Arrears to Other Multilateral and Bilateral Creditors 
223,70,Congo is also in non accrual status with other multilateral institutions including AfDB  the European Investment Bank  Paris Club creditors  and commercial banks 
224,70,The country is current only on the external debt to a few privileged private creditors associated with the collateralized debt on future oil revenue 
225,70,Under the ongoing IMF Post Conflict Emergency Assistance Program  and pending a comprehensive solution to the country s debt under the HIPC Initiative  agreement was reached for the resumption of regular payment of debt falling due to multilateral and bilateral creditors as of April 2001 
226,70,This has been done with tremendous difficulty  Arrears to AfDB presently amount to about US 86 million and arrears to bilateral Paris Club and other bilateral creditors amount to US 1 456 million 
227,70,Resolution of the country s external debt constraint under the HIPC framework presently represents the most viable route for a sustainable solution to Congo s major
228,71,debt issue  A preliminary debt sustainability analysis will soon be carried out in coordination with the Government to help Congo request substantial debt relief under HIPC Initiative 
229,72,34  Government stabilization measures under its Interim Post Conflict Program are already paying off  Non oil GDP is expected to grow by 5 8 percent in 2001 and 6 1 percent in 2002 
230,72,However  oil production is expected to go down slightly due to a lack of sufficient oil in existing wells and the delay in the construction of new oil wells 
231,72,As a result  oil GDP is projected to shrink by 0 2 percent in 2001 and 1 5 percent in 2002  and the overall GDP is expected to grow by 3 1 percent in 2001 and 2 7 percent in 2002 
232,73,35  In order to achieve broad based poverty reduction  and higher and sustained growth performance in the years to come  the agenda of reforms ahead is huge 
233,73,Continued macroeconomic stabilization  with a focus on improvement of the fiscal management taking into account the high vulnerability to oil price shocks  will continue to be a priority 
234,73,In this context  efficient management of public expenditures  with resource reallocation toward priority sectors  health  education  and infrastructure   should be the driving principle in the years ahead 
235,73,Reforms envisaged under the IMF supported Emergency Post Conflict Assistance Program  as well as the Public Expenditure Review  PER  planned in the context of the Bank s TSS  would pave the way for efficient public expenditure management 
236,73,Pursuit and deepening of structural reforms to expand the private sector and create jobs for the unemployed will also be critical 
237,74,36 
238,74,Because the oil sector is the most dominant sector of the economy  with about 67 percent of GDP  95 percent of exports  and 78 percent of total Government revenue in 2000  aggressive diversification of the economy away from oil should figure prominently in the reform agenda 
239,74,This is particularly important as the agriculture sector contributes only about 4 5 percent to GDP  13 5 percent to non oil GDP   despite the vast size of the country and its huge natural resources potential 
240,74,Private sector growth and rural infrastructure are prerequisites to diversifying the economy and achieving equitable growth in the long run 
241,74,To achieve these objectives  the Government would need to invest in rural infrastructure and an agriculture credit system for the poor  and at the same time build a business friendly regulatory framework and atmosphere for private sector growth and foreign investment 
242,74,In addition  since the economy is relatively small  economic integration with neighboring countries should be a priority for improving the country s export base and competitiveness 
243,74,Moreover  targeted internal transport infrastructure and adequate export promotion schemes will significantly help in achieving higher growth with an impact on poverty reduction 
244,75,37 
245,75,The main objective of the proposed Post Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit  Post  Conflict ERC  is to help advance the TSS goals of strengthening economic stability and supporting structural reforms 
246,75,More specifically  the proposed Post Conflict ERC will encourage the Government to pursue policy and structural reforms needed to stabilize the economy and expand the role of the private sector  including reform of the legal and regulatory framework in key sectors  improved business incentives  and market liberalization 
247,75,The proposed Post Conflict ERC would also help implement the privatization program  including restructuring cum privatization of all commercial banks  privatization of all forestry companies  and privatization of all key public utilities  water and electricity  telecommunications  railway  oil downstream activities  
248,75,These structural reforms would help pave the way for the transition from a state  controlled economy to one that is market based 
249,75,In addition  the proposed Post Conflict ERC would also aim at introducing greater transparency and improved governance in the management of key areas  oil and forestry resources  public funds  
250,76,38 
251,76,The proposed Credit  encompassing a number of policy actions  would provide critical financing necessary to advance structural reforms and governance transparency measures of the Government s 2000 2002 Interim Post Conflict Program  as outlined in the policy matrix 
252,76,The Credit will be disbursed in a single tranche of US 37 5 million  to assist the Republic of Congo with the foreign exchange cash flow  immediately after the arrears to the World Bank have been paid 
253,76,Signing of the proposed Credit will not take place until all arrears have been cleared  Credit proceeds will be released only after Credit effectiveness 
254,76,The clearance of arrears before disbursement of the single tranche will be made possible by a bridge financing loan currently being negotiated between the Government of Congo and a third party 
255,76,The policy package draws on the ongoing policy dialogue with the Government in various sectors  and on the preparatory work carried out in the preparation of the IMF Emergency Post Conflict Program 
256,76,The program will be phased to address immediate priorities in the first year  and will be implemented over a two year period  starting in July 2001 and ending in June 2003 
257,77,39 
258,77,Under the ongoing IMF Emergency Post Conflict Assistance Programs  June 1998 and November 2000   which followed the 1997 and 1998 99 wars  the Congolese Government embarked on measures aimed at enhancing sound macroeconomic policies and stabilizing the economy 
259,77,The economy remains poorly diversified  with a very high dependence on oil 
260,77,More than 70 percent of Congolese still live under the international poverty line of US 1 day  nearly 60 percent of the labor force is unemployed  and social indicators are worsening 
261,77,Given the country s wealth potential  the pervasiveness of poverty in Congo is unacceptable from a development perspective  as it undermines the sustainability of the very reforms needed to put Congo back on a sustainable higher growth path 
262,77,In addition  the increasing number of poor and unemployed youth could jeopardize the present peace and stability 
263,77,Without a strong response of private sector investment in non oil sectors  a diversified Government resource base  a
264,78,responsive financial sector  and improvements in economic infrastructure  post and telecommunication  water and electricity  railway  rural roads   the productive capacity of the economy would remain weak and higher growth would neither be achieved nor sustained 
265,78,In conjunction with other operations envisaged in the TSS  Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project  Infrastructure and Improvement of Living Conditions Project   the proposed Credit will aim to correct the identified weaknesses by supporting the deepening of structural reforms  the pursuit of market liberalization  and the continued privatization of public enterprises to foster efficiency and enhance productive capacities 
266,79,40  Poor governance over the last four decades has been one of the main sources of conflicts in Congo 
267,79,With the country s considerable oil resources  it is the third largest oil producer in Africa  after Nigeria and Angola  and extensive forests  the Government of Congo has been the sole manager of oil revenue  sharing the oil wealth through distribution of rewards and employment in oversized public enterprises and bloated bureaucracy 
268,79,The political struggle over the control of the state in Congo has therefore been synonymous with the economic control of oil 
269,79,The vast majority of the population  more than 70 percent  in the Congo presently lives under the international extreme poverty line  and successive Governments have failed to use the country s endowment to improve the population s overall living standards 
270,79,Given the role of Government as the sole manager of oil and forestry resources  transparency as to how income is translated into investments in development will be paramount 
271,79,It is therefore essential to lay the foundation for better governance and increased transparency in the management of oil wealth and forestry resources  and thereby minimize future tensions over the control of the country s wealth 
272,80,41 
273,80,The proposed Post Conflict ERC will support the Government s 2000 2002 Interim Post Conflict Program  built on two legs around the agenda of   a  pursuing structural reforms halted by the conflict  and  b  improving governance and transparency in the management of the country s natural wealth and public funds 
274,81,42  The Structural Reforms Component 
275,81,This component would help deepen structural reforms through policy measures that would improve macroeconomic performance and create a propitious business regulatory environment to enhance production  promote private sector development  and boost growth 
276,81,The reform measures envisaged under the proposed Credit will be critical to reverse the deterioration of living standards and remove key constraints on growth 
277,81,These reforrns include   a  the restructuring cum privatization of one of the three commercial banks  the UCB  as described earlier in the Government s Medium Term Program  and  b  significant progress toward privatization of all public utilities by launching of a bidding process for the concession of water electricity and electricity companies  and bringing to the point of private concession the railway company 
278,82,43  The Transparency and Governance Component 
279,82,Because poor governance and lack of transparency in the management of the country s oil over the last 40 years has been cited as one of the main reasons for the conflicts of the last decade  addressing transparency and governance issues could be achieved in Congo through measures aimed at effective implementation of a framework formalizing and clarifying relations between the state and the national oil company 
280,83,the SNPC  as described in the Government Medium Term Program  The proposed Credit would help achieve that goal 
281,84,44  Other Measures 
282,84,The Government s tax collection and revenue administration and expenditure management are being strengthened by measures  including monitoring of actual expenditures  that are being carried out in the context of the ongoing IMF Emergency Assistance Program 
283,84,In parallel with the implementation of the Post Conflict ERC  the Government intends to carry out a Public Expenditure Review to identify budget reform measures to enhance transparency and accountability  and the poverty reduction impact of the budget 
284,84,These actions would be supported by the accompanying Governance and Transparency Capacity Building operation 
285,85,45  Tranching 
286,85,The proposed Post Conflict ERC is expected to be disbursed in a single tranche of US 37 5 million  to assist the Republic of Congo with the foreign exchange cash flow immediately after the arrears to the World Bank have been paid 
287,85,Signing of the proposed Credit will not take place until all arrears have been cleared  Credit proceeds will be released only after Credit effectiveness 
288,85,The policy package of the proposed Post Conflict ERC draws on the work progress achieved in 1999 and 2000 in the context of the Government s 2000 2001 Interim Post  Conflict Program 
289,85,Board presentation  Credit effectiveness  and release of the single tranche will be conditioned on the maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework  as agreed with the Bank and the IMF 
290,86,46  Conditions for Board presentation  As conditions of Board presentation  the Government has already satisfactorily completed the following actions 
291,87,The restructuring cum privatization of the Union Congolaise des Banques  UCB   was completed with its takeover by a foreign private investor  and its restructuring finalized with the split of the bank into a healthy unit taken by the foreign private investor  and a liquidation structure transferred to a Government s agency  the Caisse Congolaise d Amortissement  CCA 
292,87,Significant progress toward privatization of key public utilities has also been made with the completion of the launching of the bidding process for the concession or leasing of water and electricity companies 
293,87,A notice was sent for advertisement of the bidding process for the privatization of these two public utilities in local and international newspapers 
294,87,Also  the notice of request for expression of interest for the private concession of the Congo Ocean railway  CFCO  has been prepared and sent for advertisement in local and international newspapers 
295,88,The operational framework between the national oil company and Govemrnment  underlining transparent mechanisms for oil revenue transfers from the SNPC to Government  was signed by chairman and CEO of SNPC  the Minister of Oil Industry  and the Minister of Finance and Budget on June 29  2001 
296,88,This substantial improvement in the transparency of oil revenue management in Congo 
297,89,a major departure from past opaque practices  provides for transparency in all SNPC transactions  regular publication of actual revenues collected from all sources  revenue forecasts  revenues transferred to the Government  publication of all transactions and trade practices  regular audits  and publication of SNPC financial statements 
298,90,47  Condition for Credit Effectiveness  and Release of the Single Tranche 
299,90,Satisfactory clearance of arrears to the Bank  as well as refund of the outstanding balances in the special accounts of the closed operations in the past portfolio  will be required before signing and effectiveness of the Credit 
300,91,48  Monitorable Benchmarks 
301,91,As provided under the TSS  performance indicators with which to monitor progress toward achieving the goals of Congo s reform program will be worked out with the authorities 
302,91,Some of these will be monitored by Bank staff to assess how the proposed Post Conflict ERC contributes to the success of the Government s efforts 
303,91,Progress and outcome indicators in the following areas will be monitored in the proposed credit   a  management of the reform process   b  management of the external debt and adequacy of the budget   c  budget formulation and efficiency  and  d  transparency and accountability in the public sector 
304,91,A matrix summarizing means of verification of progress and outcome indicators of the Credit  as well as important assumptions  follows in Annex B2 
305,92,49  Overall Coordination of the Credit 
306,92,The Government s reform effort  supported by the proposed EERC  will be managed under the overall supervision of a high level steering committee chaired by the Minister of Finance and Budget  MOF  
307,92,The committee is composed of key ministers  including the Minister of Forestry Economy  the Minister of Youth  the Minister of Education  the Minister of Health   as well the head of the committee in charge of the implementation and monitoring of the peace accords  and representatives of the Presidency  
308,92,An inter ministerial technical committee  headed by a high level coordinating staff  and comprising senior level staffs from various line ministries  will assist the steering committee on a day to day basis and will be responsible for monitoring the program  including policy indicators  and coordinating the activities of all Government agencies involved in implementation of the reform program 
309,92,The inter ministerial technical committee will also include NGOs and representatives of civil society  The technical committee will regularly inform the Bank about the progress of implementation 
310,92,The overall reform program will be reviewed by the Government in close coordination with regular Bank and IMF missions to ensure continued implementation of all reforms within a sound macroeconomic framework 
311,93,50  Disbursement Mechanism  The borrower will be the Republic of Congo  represented by the Minister of Finance and Budget 
312,93,Upon approval of the Credit  the MOF will open an account at the regional Central Bank  the Banque des Etats de l Afrique Centrale  BEAC  
313,93,At the request of the MOF  IDA will deposit the proceeds of the Credit in the Government s deposit account 
314,93,IDA disbursement will not be linked to specific purchases and  hence  there will be no procurement requirements 
315,93,In case the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible purposes  e g   to finance items imported from non member countries  or goods or services on IDA s
316,94,standard negative list   IDA will require the borrower to either   a  return that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes  or  b  refund the amount directly to IDA  in which case IDA will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the Credit 
317,94,IDA reserves the right to require an audit of the deposit account 
318,95,51  Risk Management 
319,95,Recognizing the capacity weaknesses as Congo comes out of the conflict  Government expenditure management and processes are being reinforced to ensure that funds are used appropriately 
320,95,To improve overall financial integrity and accountability in the management of public funds  improved expenditure controls and management systems  auditing systems and anti corruption actions are also being addressed in the governance and transparency component of the proposed operation  as well as the accompanying Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project 
321,95,For the medium term  further reform of public expenditure processes  and procurement processes are being pursued with IMF and French technical assistance to build the necessary capacity and systems 
322,95,The Bank will plan in the months ahead to undertake a detailed CFAA  Country Financial Accountability Assessment  that will serve as the basis for an action plan to address identified weaknesses in risk management and public financial accountability over the medium term 
323,96,52  The program is classified as environmental category C because no component is expected to have environmental impact 
324,97,53  Government ownership of the Post Conflict ERC and the program it supports is adequate to ensure its successful implementation 
325,97,During the Post Conflict ERC identification  appraisal and post appraisal missions  broad based discussions of the Post Conflict ERC were carried outside of the Government with trade unions  local and international NGOs  the private sector  and donors present in the field 
326,98,54  The potential benefits of support to Congo in the form of the proposed Post Conflict ERC largely outweigh the high level of risk 
327,98,The first benefit is that the Credit would support policies to help stabilize and revive the economy  The second benefit is the resolution of the IDA IBRD debt arrears constraint 
328,98,Without the foreign exchange cash flow provided by the proposed operation  the Republic of Congo would find it very difficult to clear its arrears to the Bank  and access to Bank financial and other support would not be restored 
329,98,The third benefit is the restoration of financial discipline  as the proposed Credit would help restore transparency and better governance in the management of public funds 
330,98,The fourth benefit is the expected increase of both domestic and foreign private investments  with improvement in business climate and growth spreading to many sectors 
331,99,55  In light of Congo s lack of a track record in implementing reform programs  as well as its relatively fragile political situation  the proposed credit is at considerable risk 
332,99,The first risk is political and social  associated with the failure of the process of transition to democracy to build a political system that would resolve differences without recourse to violence 
333,99,Such a failure could lead to slippage in implementation  reversals in the reform package  and renewed conflict 
334,99,In the face of continued political and social instability  the Government s determination to sustain implementation of the privatization program may be called into question  while efforts toward increased transparency and better governance may not figure high on the agenda of priorities 
335,99,However  the resolve shown at the highest level of the present Government provides assurance that measures agreed in the proposed Credit will be fully implemented 
336,99,Also  despite the lack of formal programs with IMF or the Bank since 1998  the Government has demonstrated its ability to stay the course of reforms 
337,99,This gives some reassurance that internal pressures can be managed and policy reversal avoided 
338,99,Furthermore  to minimize the risk of policy reversal  the program is front loaded and designed to emphasize actions taken prior to Credit approval 
339,99,Finally  with the proposed launching of a national campaign to raise awareness about the expected benefits of the reforms  support for reforms will be strengthened on a larger scale 
340,100,56  The second risk is a possible failure of the international community to provide the needed financial support 
341,100,Such a failure could hinder the Government s ability to service its debt  reconstruct its administrative and economic infrastructure  and rehabilitate some of the social facilities destroyed  particularly health and education  
342,100,This will also imply slowing the pace of the peace and national reconciliation process  and thus exacerbating poverty and social distress 
343,100,The Government is aware that mitigation of this risk is largely dependent on donors  assessment of developments in the political area 
344,100,In this respect  the successful conclusion on April 14  2001  of the national dialogue on a new constitution and the convention for peace and national reconciliation is an encouraging sign for continued efforts toward peace and the evolution of democratic institutions in Congo Brazzaville  after years of war and social unrest 
345,100,Once approved by the National Transition Council by mid  2001  a constitutional referendum will be organized during the dry season by August September 2001  to be followed by local  parliamentary  and multiparty presidential elections by the end of 2001 early 2002 
346,100,The Government s holding of free and fair elections in 2001 2002 will be a critical determinant of continued donor support 
347,101,57  The third risk is that the Government s weak institutional and administrative capacity could lead to delays in the implementation of key measures 
348,101,In this context  the inter ministerial coordination and follow up committee will improve its coordination mechanisms and mobilize a full time technical team to work on program design and implementation 
349,101,In addition  the accompanying Transparency and Governance Capacity Building Project will provide technical assistance in the design and implementation of several measures supported by the Credit  while technical assistance is also being provided by the AfDB  the EU  and France 
350,102,58  The fourth risk is the failure of the private sector to seize the investment opportunities opened by the liberalization of markets and the disengagement of the state from public enterprises 
351,102,Such a failure could be provoked by the Government s inability to develop a clear direction for an accelerated economic liberalization strategy  which would delay private sector
352,103,investment and growth  This could be mitigated by strong and aggressive public relations campaigns abroad on investment opportunities and prospects in Congo Brazzaville 
353,103,Such a campaign could also build credibility for an aggressive reform program 
354,104,59  The fifth risk is the intensification of conflict in neighboring DRC and Angola 
355,104,The field liaison office recently reestablished in Brazzaville would  inter alia  help monitor the regional security situation and assess its risks on the emerging portfolio  in collaboration with the UN system and donors present in the field 
356,105,60  The risks are considerable in Congo  but the cost of no support from the international community would exacerbate the violence  which has been clearly under control since the end of 1999 
357,105,A lack of support from the international community would also create a lost generation of uneducated youngsters who could be a danger to the society in the years to come  as the social systems further fall in disarray 
358,105,Uncontrolled violence and continued instability in the Republic of Congo would also have severe implications for peace in the delicate Great Lakes region and for all of Central Africa 
359,106,61  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association  and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it

422,145,In recent years  the social and political scene has been marked by successive armed conflicts which have resulted in heavy losses of human life  caused over one third of the Congolese population to flee their usual place of residence  undermined basic infrastructures and destroyed much of the means of production 
423,145,At the end of the 1997 conflict  reconstruction needs had been estimated at 500 billion CFA francs 
424,145,When these estimates are updated to take into account the 1998 and 1999 clashes  the total could reach 1 600 billion CFA francs  which is well above 1999 GDP 
425,145,These clashes had very dramatic effects on the economic and social fabric 
426,145,As far as the economy is concerned  non oil GDP declined by 19 percent over the period 1997 98 and consumer prices fluctuated considerably because markets were inadequately supplied and transport and communications infrastructures had been damaged 
427,146,2 
428,146,The social situation is characterized over this period by considerably insecurity because of population movement and weak economic activity due to the destruction of labor tools and the resulting unemployment  which is estimated to affect over 50 percent of the active population and particularly young people 
429,146,In addition  the presence of a large number of refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo created additional tension resulting from overpopulation 
430,146,Although the Government mobilized considerable resources to deal with the urgent needs created by the various conflicts  much more is still needed for the reconstruction of basic infrastructures  improvement of living conditions and resettlement and reintegration of displaced populations and demobilized young people 
431,147,3  The agreements on a cease fire in the Republic of the Congo signed on 16 November and 20 December 1999 laid the foundations for a return to peace 
432,147,To date  significant progress has been made in implementing the Government s program of disarmament  demobilization and rehabilitation  which includes the collection of arms and ammunition and the reintegration into society of former militiamen 
433,147,Thus  after so many painful and regrettable episodes  the Congo is
434,148,back on the road to peace   a peace consolidated by the smooth organization of an all inclusive national dialogue from 17 March to 14 April 2001 
435,149,4 
436,149,These meetings enabled almost 1 500 delegates from all backgrounds and shades of opinion to talk  exchange views and achieve consensus on the essential issues underlying a calm and peaceful course for the nation 
437,149,As a result  the route is now mapped out for a return to normal and democratic life  in which the general elections to be held very shortly are the focal point and the rendez vous desired by Congolese men and women and   why not    by all friends of the Congo 
438,149,In 1999  in order to create the social conditions to allow large scale popular participation in this political normalization process  the Government had already drawn up an Interim Post Conflict Program  PIPC  for the period 2000 02  which was adopted by the National Transition Council 
439,149,The main goals of this program are   a  reconstitution and strengthening of institutional and administrative capacities  by laying the foundations for good governance and application of rules of transparency  and  b  improvement of the macroeconomic framework and of the social climate to stimulate the economy s supply capacity and promote economic growth 
440,150,5 
441,150,In order to achieve these goals  the government intends    a  to restore the principal macroeconomic balances   b  to implement structural reforms  including reform of the civil service and privatization of commercial banks and of the largest public enterprises   c  to rehabilitate basic infrastructures   d  to combat poverty through creation of jobs  particularly for young people  and to strengthen investment capacities in the social sectors  health and education    e  to revive agricultural activities and improve food security   f  to promote economic diversification and subregional integration  and  g  to create a regulatory and institutional framework conducive to business expansion 
442,150,The formulation of these goals and these ambitions reflects political and social choices including   a  political pluralism  democracy and freedom of expression   b  disengagement of the State from productive sectors   c  entrepreneurial freedom and free competition 
443,151,6  The Congolese Government is committed to the pursuit of a development policy backed by a Post Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit  Post Conflict ERC  
444,151,In order to launch this policy  it intends to seek the support of the international community and particularly of the World Bank 
445,152,7  In recent years  the Congolese economy has been characterized by an erratic pattern reflecting the various social and economic upheavals experienced by the country over this period 
446,153,8  For more than two decades  the Congolese economy s growth has been attributable almost exclusively to the performance of the oil sector 
447,153,However  this heavy dependence of the economy on oil is very risky  particularly because this is a non renewable resource and the oil market is difficult to control 
448,153,In addition  account must be taken of the poor governance and social and political upheavals experienced by the country 
449,154,9  When civil war broke out in mid 1997  the Congolese economy had already been weakened by years of mediocre economic management and poor governance and by an earlier conflict in 1993 94 
450,154,In 1996  for example  real GDP was only 1 5 percent above the 1992 level and  at the end of the year  the stock of external debt arrears amounted to almost 50 percent of GDP 
451,155,10  Between 1997 and 1999  the deterioration in GDP in real terms went from  2 4 percent to  3 2 percent 
452,155,As a result  the management of public finances was seriously disrupted  official budgetary procedures were not strictly observed and expenditure on security and humanitarian assistance acquired top priority 
453,155,In the absence of adequate domestic and external financing  the budget deficit was financed mainly by accumulation of arrears  which resulted in deterioration in the balance of payments and exhaustion of the country s foreign currency reserves 
454,155,As a consequence  external debt arrears increased  amounting to 94 percent of GDP by the end of 1999 
455,156,11  For the financial year 2000  the real growth rate increased significantly  reaching 7 9 percent 
456,156,This good performance was achieved mainly thanks to the solidity of the oil sector  increase in oil prices  strong dollar  
457,157,12 
458,157,Mainly because of supply disruptions  inflation measured by the consumer price index fluctuated widely between 1996 and 1999  reaching 16 4 percent at the end of 1997 and then falling to 4 1 percent at the end of 1999 
459,158,13  The domestic market situation continued to stabilize in 2000  reducing inflation to 2 7 percent 
460,159,14  In the budgetary area  official procedures were not properly followed in the period 1996  99 
461,159,Expenditure was redirected to meet security needs and the urgent demand for food aid for persons affected by the conflict 
462,160,15  Budget revenue represented 28 percent of GDP in 1996  compared with 27 percent in 1999 
463,160,At the same time  current expenditure excluding interest increased from 13 0 percent of GDP in 1996 to 27 0 percent in 1999  thus reducing the primary balance surplus from 10 percent of GDP in 1996 to only 5 percent of GDP in 1999 
464,161,16  In 2000  revenue accounted for 27 percent of GDP while expenditure accounted for 26 percent  This can be attributed to the good performance of the oil sector 
465,162,17  The financial situation of the three commercial banks  which was already alarming before the outbreak of the 1997 conflict  has seriously deteriorated 
466,162,The national payments system has ceased to function  which has accelerated the collapse of activity and complicated the management of public finances 
467,162,To date  only the Union Congolaise des Banques has been repurchased by COFIPA  while the two others are the subject of negotiations between the Government and potential partners 
468,163,18  The Government anticipates that the negotiations will be completed by 30 September 2001 
469,164,19  With regard to the monetary situation  net State credit  as a percentage of money supply in the broad sense  decreased from 17 2 percent in 1997 to   19 5 percent in 2000 
470,164,This was mainly due to the forced accumulation of State deposits as banks suffered from increasing illiquidity and were unable to honor checks drawn on them 
471,164,These difficulties prevented the economy as a whole from benefiting from sizable bank lending for reconstruction and economic recovery  7 3 percent in 1997 and 9 2 percent in 2000  
472,165,20  Over the same period  money supply in the broad sense remained stable  9 5 percent in 1997 and 9 2 percent in 2000  
473,166,21  The capital account remained in deficit between 1997 and 1999 because new financing dried up 
474,166,At the same time  payments under the public debt amounted to 20 percent of GDP and 28 percent of non factor goods and services 
475,167,22  Direct investments and other private inflows remained in surplus  because of the development of oil sector activities 
476,167,The global balance of payments deficit was largely financed by accumulation of new external arrears 
477,168,23  In the next few years  the oil sector will remain the biggest contributor to budget revenue 
478,168,According to updated projections  oil output will be 12 9 million tons in 2001 and will continue to decline to 11 8 million tons in 2003  before increasing to 14 4 million tons in 2004 
479,168,The new deeper offshore oil wells will not offset the declining output of those already in operation 
480,169,24 
481,169,Accordingly  in order to diversify the economy  the Government must envisage an increase in the contribution of the non oil sector to GNP and job creation  which is a means of promoting social cohesion and an effective weapon in the fight against poverty 
482,170,25  Improvement of the country s political and security situation will lead to economic recovery in general and particularly in the sectors of agriculture  forestry  trade  transport and public works 
483,170,The goal will be to increase the share of the non oil sector in overall GDP 
484,171,26 
485,171,As far as the social sectors are concerned  the Government is committed to restoring services  particularly in the areas of health  primary health care  education  environmental sanitation  the judiciary and highway maintenance 
486,171,It will enlist the participation of the private sector in poverty relief by formulating a pilot program to channel external aid  UNDP  EU        towards NGOs and other grassroots organizations 
487,172,27  The strategy will concentrate on    poverty relief as a catalyst for growth    involvement of the people  particularly women and young people  in poverty relief 
488,173,28 
489,173,Implementation of this strategy will require mobilization of considerable financing for sound investment projects focusing on rehabilitation and development of basic social infrastructures  education and health 
490,174,29 
491,174,Public and private investment will increase in response to structural reforms  improvement in the business climate  increased activity and efforts to promote good governance and transparency in the management of public affairs 
492,174,The growth in non oil real GDP will be 7 0 percent in 2000 and 6 8 percent by 2005 
493,175,30  The current account deficit will decrease from 17 7 percent of GDP in 1999 to 6 6 percent in the period 2000 02 
494,175,Despite the possibility of a continuous adjustment after the end of the program and a probable rescheduling with Paris Club creditors under Naples terms  large financial shortfalls will continue throughout the period 2002 05  demonstrating the need for continuing aid 
495,176,31 
496,176,The National Forum for Unity  Reconciliation and National Reconstruction  meeting in January 1998  had decreed a return to democratic life and  for that purpose  proclaimed a flexible three year transition period 
497,177,32  A National Transition Council  with 75 members  was established by the Forum and acts as the legislature 
498,178,33  A constitutional commission was set up to draft the new Constitution 
499,178,At the conclusion of the all inclusive National Dialogue  a preliminary draft of the Constitution was adopted by all Congolese men and women at home and abroad 
500,179,34 
501,179,The Congolese authorities thus resolutely embarked on the road to peace and national reconciliation and committed themselves to restoring the democratic process and preparing free  transparent and fair elections as soon as possible 
502,180,35  The Government conducted an administrative census to count the electorate and establish electoral rolls 
503,180,The terns of reference of a democratization program were drawn up to cover the electoral process and the exercise of human rights 
504,180,The Government has requested the help of experts from the European Union and the possible participation of other donors 
505,181,36 
506,181,As a result of the Government s efforts to achieve its goal of creating all the prerequisites for political and social stability in order to minimize the  country risk  and its commitment to peace and national reconciliation  the Congo was classified in phase 2 of the United Nations security classification and cease fire agreements were concluded with militiamen active in the southern regions of the country on 16 November and 29 December 1999 in Pointe Noire and Brazzaville respectively 
507,182,37 
508,182,In this country in the throes of administrative upheavals  one of the Government s major goals is to stabilize the political situation while consolidating democratic power  despite the successive crises 
509,183,38  In view of economic globalization and the intensification of international competition  the Government has formulated a program to enhance competitiveness  with the following main elements 
510,184,  promotion of domestic and foreign competition    gradual elimination of quantitative restrictions and non tariff barriers    full implementation of the Regional Reform Program  particularly as regards
511,185,intra Community trade    rationalization of national taxes and import duties without obstructing business
512,186,expansion    rationalization of investment incentives and facilitation of business start ups    application of OHADA rules 
513,187,39  Over 68 percent of the Congo s foreign trade is with the European Union and over 28 percent is with African countries  including 6 percent with CEMAC countries 
514,187,The Congolese economy is thus highly vulnerable to external shocks  With a population of 2 8 million  the Congo is still a small market 
515,187,A strategy must therefore be devised for the development of subregional trade  in view of the geographical location of the Congo  which is destined to be a transit country 
516,188,40  Accordingly  within the framework of sub regional integration  the Government intends to take advantage of its membership in sub regional economic groupings  particularly CEMAC and CEEAC 
517,189,41 
518,189,As an integrated and multidimensional economic and monetary community  CEMAC is the right institutional framework for harmonious and interlinked development of member States via coordination of macroeconomic policies  stability of the common currency and creation of sectoral policies 
519,190,42  In order to accelerate the process of subregional integration  efforts are being made by CEMAC Heads of State  who are determined to facilitate the circulation of persons and goods 
520,191,43  This improvement is being sought as part of a global process respecting the interests of each country 
521,192,44 
522,192,The reforms under way  combined with transport infrastructure improvements  are designed to stimulate intra Community trade  which should generate jobs and additional revenue for State budgets in the form of fiscal revenue 
523,193,45  With a view to restoring a modernized public administration  the Government has set itself the following goals 
524,194,  provision of an urgent operational response to problems of economic and financial management    development of strategic programming capacities  starting with a few priority sectors    initiation of administrative reform  including decentralization  in public government services  as the first stage in a global process of modernization of public administrations 
525,195,46  The Government will concentrate on management of public finances  direction of the economy  strategic management and horizontal and vertical management of all resources 
526,195,Accordingly  it plans to implement a institutional support project to strengthen the management capacity of the State s administrative structures responsible for the macroeconomic framework in the Congo 
527,196,  identify the various departments concerned  as well as the selected components in these departments    evaluate available human resources    ensure that these human resources are adequate for the management of the selected components    evaluate equipment and materials requirements for the execution of the various tasks 
528,197,The Government is requesting financing for this project from external partners 
529,198,48
